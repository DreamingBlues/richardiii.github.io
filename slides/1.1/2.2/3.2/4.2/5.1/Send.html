    <h1>
        The winds howl across England as war brews. You do not repeat old sins. You do not murder children in the shadows. Instead, you act with strategy—and, some dare say, with honor.

        You secretly move the princes out of the Tower and into exile in Burgundy, under loyal watch. If you fall, the York line lives. If you win, you return as both king and protector of your brother’s legacy.
        
        With the princes safe, you ride out to meet Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field. Your banner flutters—a white boar on a crimson field.
        Your troops are hardened. You command with brilliance. But Tudor has momentum, and the loyalty of some once-friends falters. The battle is brutal.

        At a crucial moment, you lead a charge to strike down Henry himself—nearly ending the rebellion in a single blow. But your horse stumbles. You are surrounded.
        
        Your final words ring out:
        
        "A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!"
        
        And then—silence.
    </br></br>
    You fall in battle, but not in shame.

    The people mourn your death more than they ever expected. You ruled without seizing the throne through blood. You protected the princes. You tried to unite England.
    
    Henry Tudor takes the crown—but with no heirs of York in his hands. Word spreads: the boys live. The crown wobbles. Your choice haunts him.
    
    Years later, one of the princes returns. England divides again.
    You ruled through influence, not violence.
You chose trust over tyranny.
You died a warrior, not a butcher.
Your legacy is divisive—but human.
