        You secretly move the princes out of the Tower and into exile in Burgundy.
        
        You ride out to meet Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field. You command with brilliance. But Tudor has momentum, and the loyalty of some once-friends falters. The battle is brutal.

            You fall in battle, but not in shame.

    </br></br>
    Henry Tudor takes the crown, but with no heirs of York in his hands. Word spreads: the boys live. The crown wobbles.

    The people mourn your death more than they ever expected.
    
    
    Years later, one of the princes returns. England divides again.
    <br><br>
    THE END!
