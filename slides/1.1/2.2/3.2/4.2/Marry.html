        It is a calculated gamble, one that only the boldest would consider. Your marriage to Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and sister to the princes, sends a message: unity.

You assure the court that the union will heal England’s wounds—joining the houses of York and Lancaster in one family. The people are hesitant, some even disgusted, but others are relieved by the appearance of peace.

Queen Elizabeth (the princes’ mother) is skeptical. But you promise her sons will remain safe—protected, you say—and that Elizabeth of York will be treated with dignity.

Henry Tudor’s claim weakens. Without Elizabeth as a bride, his banner is less compelling.

But you sense it: not all are satisfied. Your nobles whisper. The Woodvilles seethe. Buckingham vanishes. The princes grow older. And in the distance, a fleet begins to stir across the channel.
</br></br>
Henry Tudor has landed. Backed by French gold and English rebels, he marches through the countryside. Some nobles desert you. Others hesitate. The people are uncertain—but your army still stands strong.

The princes live. Elizabeth is your queen. Your crown is real. But war has come.

      1. Send the princes away for safety and march to meet Henry Tudor in battle
      <span class="details">
        Protect the heirs of York and face your enemy head-on. If you win, you restore faith and crush rebellion. But defeat means death, and the end of your line.

       2. Quietly eliminate the princes now and blame their disappearance on your enemies
      <span class="details">
        If the boys vanish, York’s bloodline ends with you. You hold the crown. You command the story. But if the people discover the truth, even victory may taste like poison.
