    <h1>
        Your marriage to Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and sister to the princes, sends a message: unity.
 The people are hesitant, some even disgusted, but others are relieved by the appearance of peace.

Queen Elizabeth is skeptical. But you promise her sons will remain protected, and Elizabeth of York will be treated with dignity.

In the distance, a fleet begins to stir across the channel.
</br></br>
Henry Tudor has landed. Backed by French gold and English rebels, he marches through the countryside. Some nobles desert you, others hesitate. The people are uncertain, but your army still stands strong.
