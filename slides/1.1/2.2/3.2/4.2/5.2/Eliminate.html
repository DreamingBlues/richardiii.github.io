One cold night, under your whispered orders, the two princes are smothered in their sleep.
By morning, the boys are gone.

You spread the story that Henry Tudorâ€™s agents infiltrated the Tower. 
The people murmur. Some believe you. Some pretend to. Most do not.

But it is too late to turn back.

</br></br>

Henry Tudor marches forward. At Bosworth Field, your armies clash. You fight like a devil unleashed. Your men see the fire in you.

Henry Tudor falls. The crown now undisputed.

But England does not cheer.
And in secret, rebellion waits for its time to rise again.
<br><br>
THE END!
