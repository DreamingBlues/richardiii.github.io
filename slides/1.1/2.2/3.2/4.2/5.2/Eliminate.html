        The Tower grows silent.

One cold night, under your whispered orders, the two princes—Edward and Richard—are smothered in their sleep. No screams, no blood. Just shadows and silence.

By morning, the boys are gone.

You spread the story that Henry Tudor’s agents infiltrated the Tower. You weep in court. You offer rewards for information. You hold Elizabeth close, and she says nothing—but her eyes are hollow.

The people murmur. Some believe you. Some pretend to. Others do not.

But it is too late to turn back.

Henry Tudor marches forward. At Bosworth Field, your armies clash. You fight like a devil unleashed. Your men see the fire in you—but also the fear. The whispers of the princes’ fate echo louder than the drums of war.

</br></br>
You win.

Henry Tudor falls. His army breaks. The crown is placed on your head again—bloodied, but secure.

But England does not cheer.

The people mourn their boy princes. The court fears you. Elizabeth of York lives beside you like a ghost. You sit the throne in victory, but not in glory. The realm is yours, but your name is poisoned.

Songs are sung of “the shadow king who walked over graves.”

And in secret, rebellion waits for its time to rise again.
