        Under cover of darkness, the deed is done.

The two young boys—once heirs, now forgotten prisoners—are smothered in their beds. No ceremony, no witnesses. Only silence.

You feel nothing.

The final loose ends are gone. There is no one left with a stronger claim. The line of Edward IV is extinguished. The crown is yours by force, by fate, by blood.

And then dawn rises on Bosworth Field.

Your army is strong. You wear the crown into battle, gleaming above your brow. But fate is no respecter of kings.

As the battle rages, your allies falter. Lord Stanley turns on you. Your forces thin. You see Henry Tudor across the field and charge him, roaring:

“A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”

But no horse comes. You fight on foot, like a lion trapped. A blade strikes true. Then another. And another.
</br></br>
You die as king, with your enemies slain, your rivals destroyed, and no heirs left to challenge your claim.

But England does not love you.

Henry Tudor takes the crown. He marries Elizabeth of York, uniting the warring houses. You are buried in an unmarked grave. The people whisper of your cruelty, your ambition, your crimes.

History remembers you not as a king...

…but as a villain.
