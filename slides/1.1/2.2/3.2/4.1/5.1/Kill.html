        Under cover of darkness, the deed is done.

The two young boys—once heirs, now forgotten prisoners—are smothered in their beds. 
The line of Edward IV is extinguished.

The crown is yours by force, by fate, by blood.

And then dawn rises on Bosworth Field.

Your army is strong. You wear the crown into battle, gleaming above your brow. But fate is no respecter of kings.

</br></br>

As the battle rages, your allies falter, your forces thin. You see Henry Tudor across the field and charge him, roaring.

In one fell swoop, he strikes you down. You die as king, but England does not love you.

As if it were fate, history remembers you not as a king, but as a villain.

<br><br>
THE END!
