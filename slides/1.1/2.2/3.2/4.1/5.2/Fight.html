“Let them live” you declare.

As your forces clash with Henry Tudor’s army, you fight like a demon, cutting a path toward the usurper himself.

You hear the horn of an unknown call.
From the battlefield’s edge, a boy rides in—a figure in royal blue.

It’s Prince Edward, your nephew.

He shouts, “I am the rightful king! Stand down!” Somehow he's escaped the Tower.

Struck by wonder you freeze, and Henry strikes you down.
<br><br>

With you dead, the princes are reclaimed by the realm.

But Prince Edward, now a young man, challenges his cousin’s claim. England plunges into a new civil war.

A new age begins, not of peace, but of fire and steel.


    </br></br>
    THE END!
