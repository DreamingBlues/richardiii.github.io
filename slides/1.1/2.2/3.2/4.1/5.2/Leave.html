        For once, Richard hesitates.

You stand in your war tent before dawn. A single candle flickers. The Tower messengers await your word.

But you say nothing.

“Let them live,” you murmur.

You ride to Bosworth Field, armored in black steel, your white boar standard flying above your host. The sky is bruised with storm clouds. Thunder growls in the distance.

As your forces clash with Henry Tudor’s army, you fight like a demon. You kill Sir William Brandon, Tudor’s standard bearer, and cut a path toward the usurper himself.

Then—

⚡ A bolt of lightning splits the sky.
From the battlefield’s edge, a boy rides in—a figure in royal blue.

It’s Prince Edward, your nephew.

He shouts, “I am the rightful king! Stand down!” Behind him rides Richard of York, and a small band of loyal knights. Somehow—they’ve escaped the Tower.

Your men falter. They don’t know who to follow. Confusion rips through the ranks.

Henry Tudor seizes the moment. He charges.

You turn your horse to face him, shouting, “A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”

But no horse comes.

Tudor strikes.

🩸 THE ENDING: “The Two Princes Return”
You fall at Bosworth, but the story doesn’t end there.

With you dead, the princes are reclaimed by the realm. Henry Tudor marries Elizabeth of York, uniting the warring houses.

But Prince Edward, now a young man, challenges his cousin’s claim. England plunges into a new civil war—a three-way struggle between York, Lancaster, and Tudor.

Your choice not to kill the boys has ensured your own legacy ends in blood, but also created a new war of succession.

A new age begins—not of peace, but of fire and steel.

    THE END!
