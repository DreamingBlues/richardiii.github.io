        Enough with shadows and false modesty.

You summon Parliament and present your case: the princes are illegitimate, their father’s marriage was unlawful, and England needs a strong ruler—you.

With your allies in place and your enemies silenced or exiled, the crown is placed upon your head. Trumpets sound across Westminster. You are no longer Protector.

You are King Richard III.

But the cost is swift.

Buckingham turns against you, disgusted by your bold seizure of power.

Rebellion ignites in the south, as nobles rally to the exiled Henry Tudor.

The people begin to murmur about the princes. "Where are they?" they ask. You keep them alive—for now—but their very existence keeps your enemies hopeful.

You raise armies. You fortify your throne. But the final reckoning is coming.
</br></br>
Henry Tudor has landed with an army. Rebellion grows. You face him at Bosworth Field. The princes remain locked away, still alive—but unseen.

This is your final act.

      1. Kill the princes before the battle
      <span class="details">
        Remove the last threat to your legitimacy. Even if you fall, they cannot replace you. But it’s a monstrous deed—and might curse your name forever.

    <a href="5.2/Leave.html" class="choice">
       2. Leave the princes alive, and fight with honor
      <span class="details">
        You ride into battle claiming righteousness and loyalty to the realm. If you win, you remain king. If you lose, your enemies may find heirs stronger than Henry.
