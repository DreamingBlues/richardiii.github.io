    <h1>
        The people see your restraint as nobility. You walk a careful line—not king, but undeniably the power behind the throne.

From the Tower, Prince Edward writes decrees under your guidance. Courtiers bow to the boy, but speak to you. You place your allies in high office and quietly exile or discredit the queen’s remaining supporters.

The younger prince, Richard of York, is less trusting. You keep a close watch on him, but for now, you let the people see two royal boys safe, smiling, and visible in public appearances. It eases suspicion.

You are seen as wise, patient... a guardian of England.

But others grow restless. The Duke of Buckingham begins to question your ambitions. Henry Tudor, exiled across the sea, hears whispers that Richard Gloucester is king in all but name.

For now, England is quiet.

But not for long.
</br></br>
Whispers of rebellion stir. Buckingham hesitates. Some nobles resent your rule. Others rally around Henry Tudor. You still control the princes and the realm, but enemies begin to unite.

You can solidify your claim or quell the unrest—but you must act.

    <a href="4.1/King.html" class="choice">
      1. Declare yourself King of England
      <span class="details">
        Push aside the fiction. Crown yourself. Say the princes are unfit or illegitimate. Use your popularity and military control to seize the throne officially. But doing so invites open rebellion.

    <a href="4.2/Marry.html" class="choice">
       2. Marry your niece, Elizabeth of York
      <span class="details">
        Unite York and Lancaster. The princes stay in the Tower, the people stay calm, and the claim of Henry Tudor weakens. But it is a strange, distasteful move—and many may recoil at the idea.
