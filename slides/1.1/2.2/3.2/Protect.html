    <h1>
        The people see your restraint as nobility. 
From the Tower, Prince Edward writes decrees under your guidance.

But others grow restless. The Duke of Buckingham begins to question your ambitions. 
Henry Tudor, exiled across the sea, hears whispers that Richard Gloucester is king in all but name.

</br></br>
Whispers of rebellion stir. Buckingham hesitates. Some nobles resent your rule. Others rally around Henry Tudor. You still control the princes and the realm, but enemies begin to unite.
