        You sense the tide shifting, but instead of meeting rebellion with blood, you open your arms.

You summon Buckingham—your former ally whose silence has grown ominous. “We have done much together,” you say. “Let us not fall apart now.” You restore some of his confiscated lands and offer him a governorship in Wales. He bows, but his eyes no longer shine with loyalty.

You send word to Lord Stanley, stepfather to Henry Tudor. You offer him safety, gold, and influence—should he remain neutral. He agrees publicly, but his private messages speak a different tone.

Even the Bishop of Ely, whom you once slighted, receives gestures of good will. “Let old wounds close,” you say with a smile that doesn’t quite reach your eyes.

To the people, you present a kinder face. You reduce taxes, proclaim days of mourning for the princes (whom you pretend are simply “missing”), and speak of peace.

And then—the unexpected happens.

❗Twist: The Queen Appears
Queen Elizabeth Woodville, widow of Edward IV and mother of the murdered princes, emerges from sanctuary.

She does not scream. She does not accuse. Instead, she publicly supports your rule, praising your efforts to restore stability. The court gasps.

Why would she do this?

Because, in secret, you have offered her daughter, Princess Elizabeth of York, as a bride to strengthen your throne—and your bloodline. The match would unite Yorkist support and silence dissent.

You’ve made the offer... but you haven’t decided whether to honor it.

     </br></br>
     Henry Tudor has landed in Wales. His army grows with every mile. His claim to the throne rests on Elizabeth of York, the last living heir of Edward IV.

You have two days before battle. The court watches your every move. So does the girl you promised to wed—your niece.

    <a href="5.1/Marry.html" class="choice">
      1. Marry Elizabeth of York
      <span class="details">
        Unite the Yorkist and Lancastrian lines. Legitimize your reign. Risk scandal, but potentially destroy Henry’s claim by taking his prize from under him.

    <a href="5.2/Break.html" class="choice">
       2. Break the promise, kill Elizabeth of York
      <span class="details">
        Remove her from the board. Show the world you will not be manipulated. Force Henry to claim the crown without the legitimacy of her blood—making him look like a usurper.
