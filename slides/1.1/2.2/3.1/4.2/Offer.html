To more nobles you send out gold, and grants, any means to buy loyalty.

But the conseuqences of your decite is not lost among your own court. Queen Elizabeth Woodville, secretly is released from sanctuary.

Suprisingly she publicly supports your rule, praising your efforts to restore stability. The court gasps.

Why would she do this?

Because, in secret, you have offered her daughter, Princess Elizabeth of York. The match would unite Yorkist support and silence dissent.

     </br></br>
     Henry Tudor has landed in Wales. His army grows with every mile. His claim to the throne rests on Elizabeth of York, the last living heir of Edward IV.

You have two days before battle. The court watches your every move.
