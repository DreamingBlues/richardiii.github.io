        The court is stunned.

The morning of the planned betrothal, Elizabeth of York is found dead in her chambers.

The nobility is shaken. Even those who supported you see the act as a final, irrevocable crossing of a line.

<br><br>
The time is come for Battle. Henry Tudor wait across the battlefield.

You lead a charge yourself, roaring, sword in hand, cutting your way through knights and footmen to reach him.

But the betrayal is complete. Surrounded, cut off, you are struck down, not by Henry, but by a soldier bearing your colors.

Your crown, now a ghost.


    </br></br>
    THE END!
