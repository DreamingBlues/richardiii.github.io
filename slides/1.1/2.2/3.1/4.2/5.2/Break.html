        The court is stunned.

The morning of the planned betrothal, Elizabeth of York is found dead in her chambers, her throat carefully slit, a single white rose left on her pillow. No culprit is named. No investigation is opened.

The whispers return, louder now.

Queen Elizabeth Woodville, having lost her daughter after her sons, falls into a grief-stricken silence‚Äîand then vanishes from court, retreating to Bermondsey Abbey. You offer no condolences.

The nobility is shaken. Even those who supported you see the act as a final, irrevocable crossing of a line.

Your gamble? That by removing Elizabeth, Henry Tudor's claim weakens‚Äîfor without her, he has no unifying bloodline, no symbol of hope for those weary of war. He becomes just another invader.

But this time, your calculation misfires.

‚öîÔ∏è THE FINAL SHOWDOWN: Bosworth Field
The sun rises on August 22, 1485.

Your army is larger. Your armor gleams. You have the throne, the crown, the might.

But you do not have their hearts.

Lord Stanley, whose son you held hostage, defects at the last moment, bringing his cavalry to Henry's side.

The Duke of Norfolk is killed early in the fighting.

The Earl of Northumberland hesitates, his troops never joining the charge.

You see Henry across the battlefield.

You lead a charge yourself, roaring, sword in hand, cutting your way through knights and footmen to reach him.

You nearly do.

But the betrayal is complete. Surrounded, cut off, you are struck down‚Äînot by Henry, but by a nameless soldier, whose blow catches you from behind.

‚ÄúA horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!‚Äù you cry, but no one comes.

üé¨ YOUR ENDING: The Tyrant Uncrowned
You ruled with cunning, calculation, and boldness. You removed all obstacles‚ÄîClarence, the princes, the nobles, and finally Elizabeth herself. But in doing so, you burned every bridge, and in the end, found yourself alone.

Henry Tudor takes the crown, marries a different noblewoman, and rewrites your history as that of a villain.

Your name becomes a warning.

Your crown, a ghost.
