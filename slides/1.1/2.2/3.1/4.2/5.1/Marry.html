    <h1>
        The court holds its breath.

You step forward before the assembled nobles, the clergy, the people. Beside you stands Elizabeth of York‚Äîgraceful, silent, and wary. You take her hand, and in a ceremony as swift as it is shocking, you bind your fates together.

The crowd murmurs. Some in horror‚Äîat the incestuous echo of uncle and niece. Others in cautious admiration‚Äîat the political brilliance of it.

You issue proclamations:

The houses of York and Lancaster are united in your bloodline.

All loyalists to Henry Tudor are declared rebels, not saviors.

The death of the princes remains an unfortunate mystery, but with Elizabeth beside you, the past is forgiven.

Your move works. Some of Henry‚Äôs potential allies hesitate. A few even defect. You‚Äôve wounded his claim‚Äînot by sword, but by marriage.

‚öîÔ∏è THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH (Alternate Timeline)
Henry Tudor marches forward still, but his support is weaker. Lord Stanley, who historically betrayed you, now stays neutral, confused by your marriage. Even Buckingham, who had been secretly plotting revolt, is forced to pause, his plans muddled by the sudden turn.

You ride into battle not as a doomed tyrant, but as a legitimized monarch, with the heir of Edward IV at your side in name and blood.

The battle is vicious‚Äîbut this time, the tide turns your way.

Henry Tudor is captured, not killed. You offer him exile in France‚Äîstripped of titles, a claimant no longer.

You remain King Richard III, crowned by both force and diplomacy.

üèÅ YOUR ENDING: The King of Iron and Silk
You ruled not only by sword, but by cunning, marriage, and restraint. You eliminated rivals with precision, claimed the throne with legitimacy, and bent even your enemies to your purpose. History still whispers of your crimes‚Äîbut England remembers you as a king who ended the Wars of the Roses without a drop of royal blood on the battlefield.

You survived. You reigned. You won.
