You step forward before the assembled nobles, beside you stands Elizabeth of York. 
You take her hand, and in a ceremony as swift as it is shocking, you bind your fates together.

The houses of York and Lancaster are united in your bloodline.

The death of the princes remains an unfortunate mystery, but with Elizabeth beside you, the past is forgiven.

Henry Tudor marches forward still, but his support is weaker. 

In the end,
Henry Tudor is captured.

<br><br>

You ruled not only by sword, but by cunning, marriage, and restraint. 
You eliminated rivals with precision, claimed the throne with legitimacy, and bent even your enemies to your purpose. 
England remembers you as a king who ended the Wars of the Roses without a drop of royal blood on the battlefield.

    </br></br>
    THE END!
