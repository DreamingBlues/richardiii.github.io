        The Tower grows colder.

        You summon two men whose loyalty is bought in silence. One night, they creep into the chamber where the boy king and his younger brother sleep. There is no screaming. No resistance. Only a soft, permanent stillness.
        
        By morning, the princes are gone.
        
        The official story is vague—illness, some say. Moved for safety, say others. But the rumors grow like rot in the walls. The people are uneasy. Nobles exchange careful glances. Still, no one dares accuse you outright—not yet.
        
        With no heirs of Edward left, you step forward. The crown is placed upon your head. Richard III, King of England.
        
        But the shadows whisper.
     </br></br>
     You are king. But your throne is slick with blood, and enemies gather in silence. Among them is Henry Tudor, a distant claimant with support in exile. Even some who once served you—like the Duke of Buckingham—begin to waver.

     You can sense rebellion in the air. You must act swiftly.

      1. Secure power through fear and execution
      <span class="details">
        Crush dissent with overwhelming force. Execute traitors. Silence critics. Rule with an iron fist. Risk becoming a tyrant in the eyes of history.

    <a href="4.2/Offer.html" class="choice">
       2. Offer pardon and reward to wavering nobles
      <span class="details">
        Try diplomacy. Buy loyalty. Restore lands, grant titles, give pardons. You may prevent rebellion—but at the cost of appearing weak or desperate.
