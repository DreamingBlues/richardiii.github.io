        You summon two men whose loyalty is bought in silence. 
        There is no screaming. No resistance. The younge Princes never stood a chance..
        
        By morning, the official story is vague and unbelievable. Illness, some say, moved for safety, say others. 
        But the people are uneasy, though no one dares accuse you.
        
        With no heirs of Edward left, you step forward.
        
     </br></br>
     You are king. But your throne is slick with blood, and enemies gather in silence.
     
     Among them is Henry Tudor, a distant claimant with support in exile. 
     Even some who once served you, like the Duke of Buckingham, begin to wonder.

     The country grows tense as the sense of rebellion fills the air.
