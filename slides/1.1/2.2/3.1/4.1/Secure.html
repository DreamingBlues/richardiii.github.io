        You feel it—the crown resting uneasily on your head. But fear is a sharper weapon than loyalty.

You summon Lord Hastings—once loyal to your brother Edward, now suspected of mourning the princes. He hesitates to bend the knee. You give the signal. His head is on the block before he finishes speaking.

Queen Elizabeth, now widowed and stripped of her sons, is broken—but still dangerous. You confine her to sanctuary. She whispers treason into the shadows, but your men watch her closely.

The Duke of Buckingham, your former ally, watches all of this and begins to doubt you. He once helped place the crown on your head. Now, horrified by the princes’ fate and the rising tide of fear, he secretly aligns with Henry Tudor. But you catch wind of it too late.

Buckingham raises rebellion in Wales. You declare him a traitor, march troops against him, and when he is captured—you have him executed without trial.

The nobles tremble. The court falls silent.

You are feared. But not loved. And across the sea, Henry Tudor sails from France, with soldiers, gold, and the blessing of discontented nobles.
        </br></br>
        It is 1485. Henry Tudor has landed in England, raising a rebel army. Nobles you thought were loyal ride to join him. The people, weary of blood and silence, begin to cheer for a new name—“Richmond!”

The final battle is near: Bosworth Field.

You know this is your last move. There is no room for subtlety anymore. Only steel and fate.

            Preserve yourself. Let your generals fight. If the tide turns, you can retreat and regroup. Live to fight another day, even if your name grows smaller.
