You summon Lord Hastings, once loyal to your brother Edward, now suspected of mourning the princes. 
He hesitates to bend the knee, and so you place his head is on the block before he finishes speaking.

Queen Elizabeth, is next. A figure too powerful to kill, you confine her to sanctuary. 

The Duke of Buckingham, your former ally, watches all of this and is horrified by your actions.
You catch wind of his secrete aliance with Henry Tudor too late.

Buckingham raises rebellion in Wales and across the sea, Henry Tudor sails from France, with the blessing of discontented nobles.

        </br></br>

        The people, weary of blood and silence, begin to cheer for a new name, “Richmond!”

The final battle is near: Bosworth Field.
