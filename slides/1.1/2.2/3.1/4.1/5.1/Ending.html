    <h1>
        The fields of Bosworth are wet with morning mist. You sit atop your warhorse, wearing a crown into battle—a king ready to carve fate with steel.

You see Henry Tudor across the field, flanked by traitors in noble armor: Lord Stanley, whose loyalty wavers, and Sir William Brandon, carrying Henry’s banner.

You raise your sword and charge directly at Henry himself.

"A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!"

You cleave through enemy lines like a blade through silk. You unhorse Sir William Brandon, striking him down. You come within feet of Henry. Your blade is high—

But Lord Stanley’s troops—who had promised loyalty—suddenly turn against you.

You are surrounded.

Your guards are cut down one by one. You fight to the last breath, blood-soaked and howling. But in the end, you fall. Not as a coward, not in exile, but as a king in battle—crimson-crowned and defiant.
You seized the throne with cunning and cruelty.

You murdered your brother and the princes.

You ruled by fear, crushed rebellion...

And died a king, sword in hand, defiant to your last breath.
In death, your name becomes a cautionary legend.
Henry VII takes the throne and founds the Tudor dynasty.
Your bones lie forgotten under a parking lot for 500 years—until they are dug up, and the world remembers your story again.
    </br></br>
    THE END!
