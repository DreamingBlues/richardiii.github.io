    <h1>
        As the sun rises over Bosworth Field, you watch from a ridge. You send your orders through messengers.
        At first, the battle leans in your favor. But then, your lords, who had pledged loyalty, defects to Henry mid-battle.
        
        Your men look for you. They expect their king to ride, to rally, to fight.
        
        But you do not come.

        By the time you attempt to flee, it is too late. Your guards are overrun. You are dragged from your horse in the woods, alive but beaten.
        
        <br><br>
        Henry Tudor is crowned Henry VII. The Wars of the Roses end. The Tudor dynasty begins.
        
        You, Richard III, are kept alive, a prisoner in the Tower, a lesson to those in the Future. Your name becomes a warning, your legend twisted by your enemies.
            
    </br></br>
      THE END
