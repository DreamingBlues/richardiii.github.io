    <h1>
        The dawn rises over Bosworth Field, and with it, the last breath of your careful schemes.

Your armor gleams—but you remain behind the front lines. From a distant ridge, you survey the battlefield. You send orders through messengers, directing troop movements like pieces on a chessboard. You trust your captains: Norfolk, Catesby, and others you’ve spared or intimidated into service.

But the battle twists.

Lord Stanley, whose loyalty was always doubtful, refuses to commit his forces to your side. His son is your hostage, but it’s not enough.

Henry Tudor fights boldly, advancing steadily toward your center.

Word reaches you that Norfolk is slain, and his men are in retreat.

Your commands become frantic. You order reserves forward—but they do not move. Treachery, hesitation, or fear—it hardly matters now.

As Henry pushes forward, cries of “Richmond! Richmond!” echo across the field. Your soldiers falter. Some begin to throw down their weapons. You realize your generals are not failing—they are abandoning you.

You prepare to flee, but your horse is lost in the chaos. You mount a borrowed steed and vanish into the fog of retreat, not as a king, but as a shadow.

⚔️ THE OUTCOME — Ending: “The Phantom King”
Richard III survives the Battle of Bosworth—not as victor, but as a fugitive. Henry Tudor is crowned King Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty and ending the Wars of the Roses.

You live in exile or hiding, your name cursed by many, feared by few, remembered by all.

No battlefield death, no glory—only whispers of a king who ruled by fear and died forgotten.

    THE END!
