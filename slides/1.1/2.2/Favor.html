    <h1>
        The court expects you to make a power play, but instead, you show restraint—or so it seems.

        You present yourself as the devoted uncle. To Prince Edward, you are loyal, kind, and wise. You flatter him, teach him courtly ways, and warn him of "untrustworthy advisors." You subtly poison his mind against Queen Elizabeth’s family—the Woodvilles—without ever lifting a finger directly.
        
        When King Edward IV dies, the lords of the realm are divided. Some want to crown Prince Edward immediately. Others are swayed by you—his protector and "guiding hand." You escort the boy to London with gentle but firm control. The queen’s allies try to resist, but Prince Edward trusts you more than his own mother.
        
        You have the boy, and through him, you begin to control the throne... without needing to destroy him. Yet.
      </br></br>
      Now, Prince Edward is living in the Tower of London—for his protection, you say. His younger brother, Richard of York, has joined him. The court watches carefully. Some still see you as a hero. Others whisper that a king’s crown is too heavy for a child.

You face a turning point. You could solidify your rule once and for all—or try to govern through the prince, as a shadow king.

      1. Have the princes quietly killed
      <span class="details">
        With both boys dead, no one can dispute your claim. The crown is yours. But such an act could turn the people and nobles against you—unless it’s done carefully, with no trace.

    <a href="3.2/Protect.html" class="choice">
       2. Keep the princes alive and rule as their Lord Protector
      <span class="details">
        You retain your power legally. Rule in the boy’s name. Manipulate him to your will. If needed, you can always remove him later. But delay risks others rallying to his cause.
