    <h1>
        
        You present yourself as the devoted uncle. To Prince Edward, you are loyal, kind, and wise. 
        You subtly poison his mind against Queen Elizabeth’s family, wihtout ever lifting a finger directly.
        
        When King Edward IV dies, the lords of the realm are divided. You escort the boy to London with gentle but firm control. 
        
        You have the boy, and through him, you begin to control the throne.
      </br></br>

        The queen’s allies try to resist, but Prince Edward trusts you more than his own mother.

      In addition, his younger brother, 
      Richard of York, has joined him. The court watches carefully.
