        The council meets in the Tower.

        Hastings arrives, confident in his status. Loyal. Trusting.

        You enter with your arm in a sling, claiming Hastings plotted your assassination. Gasps fill the room. You need no evidence. You need no trial.

        “Off with his head!” you bark.

        The executioner moves swiftly. Minutes later, Hastings is dead, and the other lords are silent—stunned, afraid. You have shown them what happens when loyalty wavers. Your grip on the throne tightens. The nobles now follow out of fear, not faith.

        But so does Buckingham. He has seen the blade.
        </br></br>
        Buckingham grows uneasy. You promised him rewards for his loyalty—land, title, wealth. 
        But you hesitate to deliver. Meanwhile, Richmond (Henry Tudor) stirs in exile, gathering support.
        You sense a coming storm. And Buckingham is no longer smiling.
