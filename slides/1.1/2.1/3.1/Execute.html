        Hastings arrives in the Tower, confident in his status.

        You enter with your arm in a sling, claiming Hastings plotted your assassination. 
      You need no evidence. You need no trial.

        “Off with his head!” you command.

        The executioner moves swiftly. Minutes later, Hastings is dead, and the other lords are stunned silent.
      Your grip on the throne tightens. The nobles now follow out of fear, not faith.

        </br></br>
        Buckingham grows uneasy. You promised him rewards for his loyalty: land, title, wealth. 
        But you hesitate to deliver. Meanwhile, Richmond (Henry Tudor) stirs in exile, gathering support.
