        Buckingham stands before you, expectant.

        He speaks of oaths made, of lands promised. He asks for what he was dueâ€”the reward for making you king.

        You stare through him. Too much he asks for, he shall have none.

Days later, word arrives, Buckingham has fled 
      and joins Richmond, the last Tudor, now sailing with an army to challenge your throne.

        You are king, but alone.
    </br></br>
        It has come to this: The Battle of Bosworth Field.
        Richmond has landed. Armies gather. Your enemies unite behind him.

        The night before battle, you are haunted by ghosts of the enemies you made. Clarence, 
        Hastings, the princes, Buckingham. All curse your name. All bless your enemy.

        Morning comes. And now, you must decide.
