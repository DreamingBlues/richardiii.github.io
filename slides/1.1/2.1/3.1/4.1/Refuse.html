        Buckingham stands before you, expectant.

        He speaks of oaths made, of lands promised. He asks for what he was due—the reward for making you king.

        You stare through him.

        “You ask much,” you say, coldly. “Too much.”

        He leaves with his head low… but his heart burning. Days later, word arrives: Buckingham has fled, and worse—he joins Richmond, the last Tudor, now sailing with an army to challenge your throne.

        You issue the order: traitor. Capture him. Execute him.

            You will not flee. You will not hide. You are Richard III—king by will, not blood. You will win by steel, or die by it.

            Slip away under cover of battle. Retreat. Live to fight another day. 
            You are too clever to die on a muddy field. Power can always be reclaimed.
