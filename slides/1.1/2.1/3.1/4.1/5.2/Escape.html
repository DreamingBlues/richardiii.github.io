    <h1>
        The morning fog hangs heavy over Bosworth Field. Richmond’s army waits. Your soldiers are uneasy—many doubt, some might even defect.

But you have decided: this is not your end.

As battle erupts, you give the order. A small cadre of loyal guards creates a distraction. You discard your royal armor. In the chaos, you flee the field—not as king, but as a shadow.

Through forests and fields, you ride. Word spreads: Richard is missing. Richmond is victorious. He is crowned King Henry VII, and the Tudor dynasty begins.

You, meanwhile, seek asylum in Burgundy, where old Yorkist allies still linger. There, you wait—plotting, watching. Your name becomes myth. A villain to some, a rightful king to others.

You have survived.
And the game is not over.

🏁 ENDING UNLOCKED:
“The Spider Abroad”
Richard escapes defeat and vanishes into exile. History claims he died at Bosworth—but rumors of his survival spread. Somewhere across the sea, a king without a crown watches the world change.

    </br></br>
    THE END!
