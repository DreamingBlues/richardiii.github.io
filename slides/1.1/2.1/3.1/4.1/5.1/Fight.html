        Dawn breaks over Bosworth Field. Mud clings to your boots. Your army is outnumbered, 
        your allies wavering, but you feel the fire still burn within.

        You mount your horse and ride into the fray—sword drawn, roaring like a beast.

        You cut down foes, carve through lines, charging toward Richmond himself. 
        Your men fall. Your horse is slain. You fight on foot, back to the mud, bloodied but defiant.

        You scream:

        “A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”

        But no horse comes.

        Richmond’s forces surround you. You are overwhelmed—not by one sword, but many.

        You fall. Richard III is dead.

        🏁 Ending: “The Tyrant’s Fall” — Canon Ending
        You seized the crown through lies, murder, and fear.

        You ruled alone.

        And you died, weapon in hand, unloved and surrounded by the ghosts of your victims.

        Richmond takes the crown, becomes Henry VII, and marries 
        Elizabeth of York—uniting the warring houses. Peace returns. For now

    </br></br>
    THE END!
