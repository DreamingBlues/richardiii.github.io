      Buckingham enters, expecting betrayal. But you surprise him.

      “Take what I promised,” you say. “And more. A king honors his word.”
      
      You grant him vast estates, elevate his title, and shower him in gold. The court watches in stunned silence. Even Buckingham falters. Suspicion dies on his lips.
      
      For the first time, you wield generosity—not terror.
      
      But something strange happens.
      
      ⚠️ UNEXPECTED TURN:
      With his new power and wealth, Buckingham does not rebel—but neither does he stay passive. He becomes an active force in your court, beloved by the people, admired by nobles.
      
      And now you are the one growing suspicious.
      
      He mediates disputes. Gains followers. Begins speaking of reform and justice. Your name is still feared… but his is loved.
      
      Whispers begin: “Perhaps Buckingham should have the crown.”
      
      You’ve bought his loyalty… and created a rival.
      
      
        </br></br>
        Richmond marches from across the sea with an army. Civil war is coming. But your power at home is no longer absolute—Buckingham’s popularity rises, and many nobles rally to him instead of you. You must act fast.

        1. Assassinate Buckingham before the battle
        <span class="details">
          Strike first. Eliminate him in secret. Without him, your enemies may splinter. But killing a hero might turn the people fully against you.

        2. Let Buckingham lead your army at Bosworth
        <span class="details">
          Keep up appearances. Let him fight in your name. Perhaps he will prove loyal… or fall in battle. Either way, he may solve himself.
