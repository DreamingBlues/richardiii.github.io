      Buckingham enters, expecting betrayal. But you surprise him.

      A king honors his word.
      You grant him vast estates, elevate his title, and shower him in gold.
              
      With his new power and wealth, he becomes an active force in your court, beloved by the people, admired by nobles.
            
      Whispers begin: “Perhaps Buckingham should have the crown.”
      
      Despite the loyalty you've bought, you've created a rival.

      
        </br></br>

        Richmond marches from across the sea with an army. Civil war is coming. 
        But your power at home is no longer absolute as Buckingham’s popularity rises, and many nobles rally to him instead of you.
