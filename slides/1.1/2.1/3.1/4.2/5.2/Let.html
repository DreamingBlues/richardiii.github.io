    <h1>
        The banners rise. Richmond approaches with his foreign-backed army. England waits to see who will wear the crown.

You meet with Buckingham in your war tent. 
“Lead the charge. Bring me his head.”

The horns sound. The battlefield churns.

Buckingham leads your troops with unmatched skill. Richmond is overwhelmed. His forces are shattered.

Richmond is captured.

<br><br>
The people cheer not out of fear, but from awe.
You reign not just through cunning and blood, but through calculated mercy and bold risk.
While Buckingham remains your right hand. The nobles follow only out of neccesity.

You are King Richard III, however this title is one hard to achieve, and harder to maintain.

</br></br>
        THE END
