        The banners rise. Richmond approaches with his foreign-backed army. England waits to see who will wear the crown.

You meet with Buckingham in your war tent. His armor gleams. His words are loyal. Yet beneath the surface—doubt coils like a viper.

Still, you say:
“Lead the charge. Bring me his head.”

Buckingham bows.

⚔️ THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH — A Forked Ending
The horns sound. The battlefield churns. And then—Buckingham turns.

But not toward Richmond.

He turns on your enemies within your own army.
He fights for you.

Your gamble pays off. Buckingham remains loyal to the end, leading your troops with unmatched skill. Richmond is overwhelmed. His forces are shattered.

Richmond is captured—alive.

And before the army, you show mercy. You spare him. You let him return to exile.

England is stunned.

The people cheer not out of fear—but from awe. A tyrant has grown into a king.

🏁 YOUR ENDING: Richard Triumphant — The Iron King, Tempered by Mercy
You reign not just through cunning and blood, but through calculated mercy and bold risk.
Buckingham remains your right hand. The nobles follow. The people respect you.

You are King Richard III—and this time, the story did not end with your body in the mud.
