    <h1>
        The night before the armies clash at Bosworth, you summon Buckingham to your tent. 
The blow is swift. Personal.

Your forces march into Bosworth fractured, afraid, and unsure. Many desert in the night. You face Richmond with a shadow of your former strength.
There are no allies left. No brothers. No Buckingham.

When time for battle, your cry rings out, but no one comes.
You fall beneath a dozen blades, alone.
<br><br>
You took the throne through blood and cunning. You killed all who stood in your way, even those who loved you.
In the end, your paranoia destroyed your only chance at survival.
Your final act of betrayal doomed your reign.

</br></br>
        THE END
    </h1>
