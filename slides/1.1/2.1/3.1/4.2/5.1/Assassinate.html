    <h1>
        The night before the armies clash at Bosworth, you summon Buckingham to your tent. He enters, unsuspecting—dressed in armor, ready to lead.

You offer him wine. A smile.

And then, a dagger.

The blow is swift. Personal.

You hold him as he bleeds—your old accomplice, your once-friend. He gurgles a final word: “Fool…”

His body is discovered the next morning. You claim it was a traitor’s plot. The army doesn’t believe you—but no one dares speak.

Your forces march into Bosworth fractured, afraid, and unsure. Many desert in the night. You face Richmond with a shadow of your former strength.

But you ride anyway, furious and proud.

⚔️ THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH
You fight like a beast. You slay Richmond’s standard-bearer yourself. You nearly reach Richmond—so close you can see the crown gleam on his brow.

But you are surrounded.

There are no allies left. No brothers. No Buckingham.

“A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”

Your cry rings out—but no one comes.

You fall beneath a dozen blades.

🩸 YOUR ENDING: "The King Who Ruled Alone"
You took the throne through blood and cunning. You killed all who stood in your way—even those who loved you.
In the end, your paranoia destroyed your only chance at survival.
Your final act of betrayal doomed your reign.

History forgets your justifications.
It remembers only the crown, and the corpses beneath it.
