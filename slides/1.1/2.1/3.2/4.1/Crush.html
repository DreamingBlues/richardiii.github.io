        Buckingham marches under grey skies, calling for the return of order and the crowning of Henry Tudor. You respond with brutality.

You send your generals, towns and castles loyal to Buckingham are razed. Buckingham's troops falter. He is captured while trying to flee. Publicly, you execute him for treason.

Buckinghamâ€™s death slows the rebellion, but the arrival of Henry Tudor is no longer rumor, it is imminent.

      </br></br>
      The fields of Bosworth await. Henry Tudor lands in England with French support and English defectors. The final battle will decide the fate of the crown.

You know some of your lords hesitate. Some may betray you in battle. You must act before the swords are drawn.
