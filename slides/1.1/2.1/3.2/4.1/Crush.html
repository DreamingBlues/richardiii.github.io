        Buckingham marches under grey skies, calling for the return of order and the crowning of Henry Tudor. You respond with brutal clarity.

You send your generals north and west. Castles are burned. Towns loyal to Buckingham are razed. No pardon. No mercy.

Caught in a flood from a relentless storm, Buckingham's troops falter. He is captured while trying to flee. Publicly, you execute him for treason.

The nobles shudder.

But the damage is done.

Buckingham’s death slows the rebellion, but the whisper of Henry Tudor now becomes a banner. His arrival is no longer rumor—it is imminent. The people are uncertain. Some fear you. Others hate you.

Your rule stands—but it trembles.
      </br></br>
      The fields of Bosworth await. Henry Tudor lands in England with French support and English defectors. The final battle will decide the fate of the crown.

You know some of your lords hesitate. Some may betray you in battle. You must act before the swords are drawn.
