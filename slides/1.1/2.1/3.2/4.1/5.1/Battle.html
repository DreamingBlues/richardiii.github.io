    <h1>
        Buckingham marches under grey skies, calling for the return of order and the crowning of Henry Tudor.
        You lead the charge, cutting through Tudorâ€™s lines like a hot knife. For a moment, the tide shifts. Men cheer. You fight like a man possessed.
        
        But then, treachery.
        
        Some of your lords turn mid-battle. Forces you thought were loyal now strike your flank. You're surrounded. Bleeding. Exhausted.
        
        You fight to the bitter end.
<br><br>
Your crown is taken. Henry Tudor becomes Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty.

        History will remember it as the death of a tyrant, or the fall of a lion, depending on who tells the tale.

      THE END
