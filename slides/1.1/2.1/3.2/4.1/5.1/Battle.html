    <h1>
        Buckingham marches under grey skies, calling for the return of order and the crowning of Henry Tudor. You respond with brutal clarity.

        You don your armor. The air is thick with smoke and betrayal. You ride to the front, sword raised high, crying:

        ‚ÄúA horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!‚Äù
        
        You lead the charge yourself, cutting through Tudor‚Äôs lines like a thunderclap. For a moment, the tide shifts. Men cheer. You fight like a man possessed.
        
        But then‚Äîtreachery.
        
        Some of your lords turn mid-battle. Forces you thought were loyal now strike your flank. You're surrounded. Bleeding. Exhausted.
        
        You fight to the end, refusing to fall back.
        
        History will remember it as the death of a tyrant, or the fall of a lion, depending on who tells the tale.
        
        Your crown is taken. Henry Tudor becomes Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty.
        
        But your legacy?
        
        Not the twisted villain of Shakespeare‚Äôs pen, perhaps.
        
        You were ruthless, yes‚Äîbut cunning, bold, and even merciful once.
        
        In this timeline, Richard III dies on the battlefield, sword in hand‚Äînot as a monster, but as a warrior-king, fallen to fate.
        
        üèÅ YOUR ENDING:
        Richard the Bold ‚Äî the Warrior King
        You died fighting for your crown, after seizing it through cleverness and strength. A legend to some, a villain to others.
      </br></br>
      THE END
