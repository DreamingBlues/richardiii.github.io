    <h1>
        As the sun rises over Bosworth Field, you watch from a ridge. Armor gleams below. You send your orders through messengers. You trust your commandersâ€”though not all of them.

        At first, the battle leans in your favor. But then, Lord Stanleyâ€”who had pledged loyaltyâ€”defects to Henry mid-battle. Your right flank collapses.
        
        Your men look for you. They expect their king to ride, to rally, to fight.
        
        But you do not come.
        
        Word spreads: "Richard is not here."
        Morale falters. Troops desert. Henryâ€™s forces press forward.
        
        By the time you attempt to flee, it is too late. Your guards are overrun. You are dragged from your horse in the woods, alive but beaten.
        
        ðŸ©¸ The Ending: Richard the Captive
        Henry Tudor is crowned Henry VII. The Wars of the Roses end. The Tudor dynasty begins.
        
        You, Richard III, are kept aliveâ€”a prisoner in the Tower. A trophy king. Your name becomes a warning, your legend twisted by your enemies.
        
        But you are not dead.
        
        Some whisper that your time may come again. That ambition like yours never dies.
    
    </br></br>
      THE END
