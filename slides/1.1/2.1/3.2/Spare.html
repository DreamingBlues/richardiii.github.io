        Instead of executing Lord Hastings—as you did in Shakespeare's play—you offer him a seat at your table. You speak to him privately. You assure him:

        “What’s done is done. The princes were a threat to peace. You and I… we are guardians of order.”
        
        Hastings is cautious, but intrigued. He remains at court.
        
        Your act of mercy sends ripples through the kingdom. Some call it weakness. Others call it wisdom. Queen Elizabeth's remaining allies pause, uncertain whether to rise or wait.
        
        Buckingham, however, begins to frown. He expected ruthlessness. He begins to doubt your resolve—and starts quietly reaching out to your enemies.
        
        You sit on the throne with fewer enemies—but more silent watchers.
        
        The game of power continues.
      </br></br>
      You now rule. But rebellion stirs. Word spreads of a Lancastrian heir—Henry Tudor—gathering support in France. Meanwhile, Buckingham has turned on you. He believes the crown no longer fits you, and seeks to restore “rightful order.”

You must act quickly.

      1. Crush Buckingham’s rebellion with overwhelming force
      <span class="details">
        Send troops, burn bridges, take no prisoners. Strike before Henry Tudor arrives. Fear will keep the nobles in line.

    <a href="4.2/Offer.html" class="choice">
        Offer Buckingham a deal to bring him back
      <span class="details">
        Send a messenger. Offer pardon, land, maybe even a promise of succession. Divide your enemies before they unite.
