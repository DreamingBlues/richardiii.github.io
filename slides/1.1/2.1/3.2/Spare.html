        You offer Lord Hastings a seat at your table. You speak to him privately, assuring him.

        Hastings is cautious, but intrigued. He remains at court.
        
        Your act of mercy sends ripples through the kingdom. Queen Elizabeth's remaining allies pause, uncertain whether to rise or wait.
        
        Buckingham, however, begins to frown. He expected ruthlessness. He begins to doubt your resolve, and you suspect him to start reaching out to your enemies.        
   
      </br></br>
      You now rule. But rebellion stirs. Word spreads of a Lancastrian heir, Henry Tudor, gathering support in France. 
      Meanwhile, Buckingham has turned on you. He believes the crown no longer fits you, and seeks to restore “rightful order”.
