        As dawn breaks over Bosworth Field, you a loyal knight dons your black amour.
        Meanwhile, cloaked and silent, you vanish.
        
        The battle is chaos. Henry Tudor charges. The false Richard falls in glorious combat, surrounded by enemies. The rebels cry out, "The tyrant is dead!"
        Henry is crowned on the field, lifting the fallen crown from the mud.
        
        He becomes Henry VII, 
        But you live.
        
<br><br>        
It does not take long for the public to find out the truth. 
You disappear into legend.
        
        Your name is cursed in England, but your story is unfinished.
        
        You are no longer King Richard III.
        
        But you are not dead.
    </br></br>
      THE END
