        As dawn breaks over Bosworth Field, you don your black armor‚Äîbut only for your double. A loyal knight, sworn to die in your name, rides into battle bearing your crest, your crown, your sword.

        Meanwhile, cloaked and silent, you vanish.
        
        The battle is chaos. Henry Tudor charges. The false Richard falls in glorious combat, surrounded by enemies. The rebels cry out: "The tyrant is dead!"
        Henry is crowned on the field, lifting the fallen crown from the mud.
        
        He becomes Henry VII. The Tudor dynasty is born.
        
        But you live.
        
        üï≥Ô∏è Epilogue ‚Äî "The Shadow King"
        You disappear into legend.
        
        Some say you fled to Burgundy, where you plot revenge.
        Others whisper you roam the north, living as a monk, haunted by ghosts.
        A few even claim to have seen a limping man with a crooked back teaching boys to read in a quiet chapel.
        
        Your name is cursed in England‚Äîbut your story‚Ä¶ is unfinished.
        
        You are no longer King Richard III.
        
        But you are not dead.
        
        Not yet.
        
        üèÅ Ending Unlocked:
        "The Exiled Spider" ‚Äî Richard lives, but the crown is lost. A monarch in the shadows. A villain‚Ä¶ or a survivor?"
