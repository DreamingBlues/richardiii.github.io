    <h1>
        The morning mist hangs thick over Bosworth Field. The banners of York flutter beside you, but many men glance sideways, unsure if they follow a king‚Ä¶ or a ghost.

You don your armor. You mount your horse. You refuse the crown they try to strap to your saddle‚Äîit belongs on your head, even in death.

From across the field, Henry Tudor watches. Cautious. Calm. Younger. Hopeful.

You spur your horse forward, breaking formation, cutting straight for Henry‚Äôs banner. Your guards scream to follow. You ride alone.

‚ÄúA horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!‚Äù
But no one hears that cry in this version‚Äîbecause you never fall.

You reach Henry.

Steel clashes. Sparks fly. Henry's blade meets yours.

You kill his standard-bearer. His guards. One by one.

Then‚Äîat last‚Äîyou clash with Henry himself.

It is not a long duel.

You are older. More ruthless. And today, you are king not just in name, but in fire.

You strike Henry down.

Your army surges forward, emboldened. The rebels scatter. Your enemies fall back. The crown remains.

üè∞ ENDING UNLOCKED: "The Bloody Crown, Still Warm"
You rule on, but England remembers Bosworth not as your fall‚Äîbut your triumph.

You are feared. Your throne secure‚Äîfor now. But mercy has weakened you, and suspicion surrounds you. Hastings watches. Buckingham broods. The sons of the dead wait to rise.

You are King.

But at what cost?

      THE END
