    <h1>
        The morning mist hangs thick over Bosworth Field. The banners of York flutter beside you, but many men glance sideways, unsure if they follow a king…or a ghost.

You spur your horse forward, breaking formation, cutting straight for Henry’s banner. Your guards, confused, scream and follow.
Reaching Henry, his blade meets yours.

It is not a long duel.

You are older, More ruthless, and wihtout hesitation you strike him down.

Your army surges forward, emboldened. The rebels are decimated. Your crown remains.

<br><br>

You rule on, with all of England fearing. In the shadows Hastings watches and Buckingham broods. 
Thou hast got one victory, until the sons of the dead wait to rise.
    
    </br></br>
      THE END
