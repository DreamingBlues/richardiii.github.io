    <h1>
        Bearing a scroll with your signet stamp, your messangers are sent to Buckingham.
        But something unexpected happens.
        Your messenger finds Buckingham already captured, by mercenaries loyal to Henry Tudor. 

        Instead of rescuing or executing him, Henry sends him to you, in an act of disrepect and pity.

        He kneels before you in shameâ€¦and fear.
      </br></br>
      But Henry Tudor is coming.

He lands in England with an army of exiled nobles and foreign mercenaries.
 Many of your former allies have defected. Those that still ride under your banner are hopelessly unloyal.
The field of Bosworth awaits.
