        Your messengers ride fast, bearing a scroll sealed with your ring. You offer Buckingham:

        A full pardon for his betrayal,
        
        Restoration of titles and lands,
        
        And—more shockingly—a promise that his son will inherit the crown after your reign, should you die without an heir.
        
        It is a gamble. A dangerous one.
        
        But something unexpected happens.
        Your messenger finds Buckingham already captured—not by your men, but by mercenaries loyal to Henry Tudor. They were marching together, but a storm had scattered them. Buckingham, isolated, was taken prisoner by the very rebellion he meant to support.
        
        Instead of rescuing or executing him, Henry sends him to you—in chains.
        
        “Let your treacherous friend return home,” Henry writes. “I have no use for turncoats. I prefer kings who kill their enemies, not beg them back.”
        
        You have won Buckingham’s return—but at the cost of your reputation.
        
        He kneels before you in shame… and fear. But he will never truly trust you again.
        
        Meanwhile, Henry Tudor is coming. He does not offer deals.
      </br></br>
      The day has come.

Henry Tudor lands in England with an army of exiled nobles and foreign mercenaries. Many of your former allies have defected. Some still ride under your banner—but not with the same fire.

The field of Bosworth awaits.

The crown rests on your head. The ghosts of Clarence, Edward, the princes, and more seem to whisper in the wind.

      1. Lead from the front. Fight Henry in single combat if you must.
      <span class="details">
        Risk everything. If you kill Henry yourself, you may crush the rebellion in one stroke. You are still Richard—the warrior king.

    <a href="5.2/Decoy.html" class="choice">
        Send a decoy in your armor. Escape the battlefield.
      <span class="details">
        Let others die in your place. Disappear. Bide your time. The throne may be lost—for now—but perhaps you can return one day, from the shadows.
