      You spread whispers in the right ears.

      “Was Edward’s marriage even legal?”
      “Didn’t he once promise himself to Lady Eleanor Butler?”
      “Are his children… bastards?”

      With Buckingham’s help, you sway the nobles. You call on your allies in the clergy. The Titulus Regius is passed. Parliament declares Edward’s sons illegitimate. The people are told the throne must pass to you, the next "lawful" male heir.

      The crowd is staged. The cries feel rehearsed. But when they call out for King Richard III, you humbly accept—grudgingly, of course.

      The young princes are taken to the Tower of London, “for their protection.”
      They are never seen again.

      The crown is yours.

      But your enemies stir.
      </br></br>
      You now wear the crown. But peace is a lie. Queen Elizabeth’s relatives plot revenge. 
      Lord Hastings, once your ally, doubts your rule. Even Buckingham is watching you closely. 
      The throne is yours—but for how long?

      1. Execute Hastings and seize full control
      <span class="details">
        Accuse Hastings of treason. Eliminate him quickly and publicly. Show your enemies that mercy is dead.

      Spare Hastings and try to build loyalty
      <span class="details">
        Rule with a lighter hand. Keep Hastings close. Use diplomacy and promises 
        to secure his loyalty—and the loyalty of others. You may avoid rebellion… or invite betrayal.
