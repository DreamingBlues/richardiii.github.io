    <h1>
        Like a spider in the dark, you whisper doubt into King Edward’s ear. 
        You remind him of Clarence’s past betrayals, his ambition, and the danger of the prophecy. 
        “G of Edward’s heirs... surely, your brother George,” you say with practiced concern.
        Edward, weakened by illness and guilt, gives in. Clarence is arrested, imprisoned in the Tower. 
        You pretend to grieve. Behind closed doors, you ensure the warrant for his execution is signed. 
        Before Edward can reverse the order, Clarence is drowned in a butt of malmsey wine—your wine.
        One threat down.
        </br></br>
        King Edward’s health declines. His two young sons—Prince Edward and Richard of York—are heirs to the throne. 
        With Clarence dead, the princes are your final obstacle. If you move too soon, you risk turning the court 
        against you. But time is short. The king could die any day.

      1. Undermine the princes by claiming Illegitimacy
      <span class="details">
        Spread rumors that Edward’s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was invalid. Convince the nobles 
        that the princes have no claim to the throne. With support, you can step in as "protector"—and then king.

      2. Win favor with the young Prince Edward
      <span class="details">
        Offer loyalty and mentorship to the boy prince. Present yourself as a trustworthy uncle. When the king dies, 
        you could rule as his advisor—or guide the boy into “accidental missteps” that clear your way.
