    <h1>
      You are Richard, Duke of Gloucester—cunning, ambitious, and hungry for the crown. The year is 1483. 
      Your brother Edward IV sits on the throne, and your other brother, Clarence, stands between you and 
      ultimate power.


      </br></br>
      The prophecy has been spoken: "G of Edward’s heirs shall be the murderer."
      You know this refers to you, Gloucester, but you twist it to point the finger at George, Duke of Clarence. 
      If Clarence is removed, you are one step closer to power. However the king is not so easily swayed.

    <a href="1.1/Manipulate.html" class="choice">
      1. Manipulate the King against Clarence
      <span class="details">
        Twist the prophecy. Play on Edward’s doubts. Convince him to imprison Clarence as a traitor, 
        even if he isn’t one. Once he's locked up, you can move to eliminate him.
      </span>

    <a href="1.2/Ally.html" class="choice">
      2. Secretly ally with Clarence
      <span class="details">
        Tell Clarence about the prophecy. Pretend to be his friend. Gain his trust and use him as a
        pawn against Edward or others at court. Later, you can betray him when it's more convenient.
