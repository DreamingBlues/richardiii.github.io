      You are Richard, Duke of Gloucester. You whole life you have been judged and unfairly discarded due to your looks. 
      These years of neglegant upbringing has lead you to be cunning, ambitious, and hungry for the crown. 
      The year is 1483. 
      Your brother Edward IV sits on the throne, and your other brother, Clarence, stands between you and 
      ultimate power.

      </br></br>
 You hear of a prophecy, "G of Edwardâ€™s heirs shall be the murderer."
      Althought it could reference George, Duke of Clarance, you know in your dark heart it refers to you, Duke of Gloucester.

      But, it could be to you benefit. If people think it refers to Clarence, that could be one obstacle out the way from the Throne.
