        Rather than move against Clarence directly, you go to him in secret, 
        speaking in hushed tones within the stone corridors of the Tower.
 
"We are both doomed to the same fate, which is why we must stand together".

        Clarence hesitates, but nods in agreement. 

        </br></br>

        King Edward's health is failing. He wishes to reconcile the royal family, unaware of your deeper plans.

        A reconciliation is held, with all nobles and the Queen. 
        You attend  the court’s gathering. If Edward dies with his alliances intact, you will be blocked from control of the young heir.
