        You take the shadowed path.

        Rather than move against Clarence directly, you go to him in secret, 
        speaking in hushed tones within the stone corridors of the Tower.

        "Brother," you say, voice like velvet and poison. "A prophecy moves 
        through courtâ€”some say G shall bring ruin upon Edwardâ€™s line. They mean you, George."

        Clarenceâ€™s eyes widen. "Surely not! Iâ€™ve done nothingâ€”"

        "Which is precisely why we must stand together," you whisper. 
        "The king grows weak, manipulated by that serpent Hastings and Queen Elizabethâ€™s kin. 
        But if we unite, we could steer this kingdom toward stability... our kind of stability."

        Clarence hesitates... then nods. A bond is formed.

        For now.

        ðŸ”€ Consequences:
        Clarence is sparedâ€”for the momentâ€”and believes you are his ally.

        King Edward remains unaware of your deeper plans.

        You now have an inside manâ€”loyal but naive.

        The court is calmâ€¦ but your ambitions simmer just below the surface.
        </br></br>
        King Edward's health is failing. He wishes to reconcile the royal family, including Clarence, 
        Queen Elizabethâ€™s relatives, and you. This would heal old woundsâ€¦ and block your path to the throne.

        You attend  the courtâ€™s gathering. The Queen and her alliesâ€”especially her brother Rivers and 
        son Dorsetâ€”gain influence daily. If Edward dies with this alliance intact, they may control the young heir.

      1. Sabotage the Reconciliation
      <span class="details">
        Spread rumors. Reignite distrust between Edward and Clarence. Ensure Clarence is arrested 
        after allâ€”but without tying it to yourself. Strike from the shadows. Burn the bridge you built.

      2. Target the Queenâ€™s Family Instead
      <span class="details">
        Keep Clarence close. Let Edward believe the family is reconciledâ€”but move secretly against Rivers and Dorset, 
        the Queenâ€™s powerful kin. Begin laying the groundwork for their downfall.
