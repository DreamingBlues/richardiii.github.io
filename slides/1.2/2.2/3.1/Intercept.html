        You ride swiftly, intercepting the young Prince Edward as he travels to London with Rivers and a modest escort. You arrive cloaked in duty and concern:

"Fear not, nephew. The city is restless, the nobles divided. For your safety, you shall stay in the Tower until your coronation."

The boy, awed and uncertain, agrees.

Rivers protests‚Äîbut your soldiers part the road with steel. He is arrested "for plotting against the crown." Dorset flees the capital. Queen Elizabeth, terrified, retreats into sanctuary with her younger son.

The prince is now under your control, lodged in the Tower ‚Äúfor his protection.‚Äù But you and your agents know: he will never leave it as king.

üîÄ Consequences:
Edward V is in your custody.

Rivers is imprisoned; Dorset is in hiding.

Clarence grows uneasy‚Äîhe did not expect such boldness.

The people murmur‚Ä¶ but none dare challenge you yet.
        </br></br>
        You now have the heir in the Tower and the Queen's allies scattered. Whispers grow that Edward IV‚Äôs marriage to Elizabeth was invalid‚Äîthat their children are illegitimate.

If that‚Äôs proven, you are the rightful heir.

But the nobility still wavers. Some are loyal to the prince, others to the idea of peace. You must decide how boldly to act.

      1. Declare the Princes Bastards
      <span class="details">
        Use your allies in the clergy and Parliament. Claim Edward IV was pre-contracted to another woman, making his marriage unlawful. Declare the princes illegitimate and claim the throne.

    <a href="4.2/Protector.html" class="choice">
      2. Rule as Protector
      <span class="details">
        Do not claim the throne‚Äîyet. Instead, have yourself named Lord Protector until the boy comes of age. Rule in practice, while keeping up the appearance of loyalty. A slower, safer path.
