        You summon Parliament. Your ally, Bishop Stillington, presents damning testimony: Edward IV was pledged to another woman before marrying Elizabeth Woodville. His union was bigamous. His sons? Bastards.

        The court gasps. Some weep, some rage‚Äîbut many nod.
        
        ‚ÄúThe line is broken,‚Äù you declare. ‚ÄúBy right of blood and law, I am your king.‚Äù
        
        And so it is. The crown is placed upon your brow. You are no longer Richard of Gloucester.
        
        You are King Richard III.
        
        Your nephew remains locked in the Tower, now a political inconvenience. His fate looms.
        
        Clarence, once your ally, sees now what you are. He withdraws in quiet horror‚Ä¶ and begins whispering with old enemies.
        
        üîÄ Consequences:
        You are crowned King.
        
        The princes are now officially illegitimate‚Äîthough still alive.
        
        The public is shaken, but not yet rebellious.
        
        Clarence may be turning against you.
        </br></br>
        You now wear the crown‚Äîbut it is not secure. Rumors spread. People whisper of the rightful heirs still living in the Tower. Clarence‚Äôs loyalty is crumbling. Rebellions stir in the countryside, murmuring the name of Henry Tudor.

Your enemies gather. Time is running short.

      1. Kill the Princes
      <span class="details">
        Silence the threat forever. Send assassins into the Tower. Kill the boys, and destroy the last rival claim to the throne. It is monstrous‚Äîbut effective.

    <a href="5.2/Keep.html" class="choice">
      2. Keep the Princes Alive
      <span class="details">
        Let them live‚Äîunder guard. Use them as hostages or pawns in diplomacy. Perhaps they will be forgotten. Perhaps you can rule without spilling more royal blood.
