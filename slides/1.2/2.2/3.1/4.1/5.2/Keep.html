        You stare into the darkness of the Tower, into the faces of two boys—your kin, your obstacles.

And you walk away.

“Keep them under watch,” you command. “No visitors. No messages. No blade. No poison. Let them live… and let them vanish.”

The princes remain alive, but unseen. Rumors spread: some say they’ve been smuggled away. Others say they died in secret. But you? You said nothing. You did nothing.

Your conscience is not clean—but it is not yet damned.

🔀 Final Consequences:
The crown rests on your head, but wobbles.

Clarence has joined a brewing rebellion with Henry Tudor.

Many nobles now believe you lack the will—or the cruelty—to hold power.

The mystery of the princes haunts the people, splitting your support.

The field is set. The armies gather. Bosworth approaches.

The year is 1485.

You, King Richard III, rule from a fortress of caution and shadow. The princes live—hidden, watched—but their very existence is a crack in your crown. Their survival inspires whispers:

“Perhaps the true king still lives.”

Your restraint, meant to preserve your soul, becomes your undoing.

Clarence—bitter and betrayed—secretly allies with Henry Tudor, a distant Lancastrian with just enough claim and far more ambition. He promises peace, legitimacy, and revenge for the imprisoned princes.

Your own nobles—uncertain of your right and unnerved by your mercy—begin to shift allegiance. Quietly. Reluctantly.

Then comes Bosworth Field.

⚔️ The Battle
You ride into battle with steel in your heart, crying:

“A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”

But none come. Those who once rallied to you hold back. Some even switch sides mid-battle. You fight like a demon—but you fall, surrounded and alone.

Your crown is taken from the battlefield and placed upon Henry Tudor’s head, who becomes King Henry VII.

The princes? Vanished forever.

Your name becomes legend—not as a king, but as a question mark in history. Ruthless, but not ruthless enough. Clever, but not feared. A king with blood on his hands—but not enough to secure his throne.

🩸 Your Ending:
"The Unfinished Villain"
You reached the throne without killing your soul completely—but failed to keep it.
You are remembered not for what you did, but for what you hesitated to do.

        The END
