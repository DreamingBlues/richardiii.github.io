        In the dead of night, two men ascend the winding steps of the Tower with no names and no future.

The young princes—Edward and Richard—sleep soundly in their chamber. They never wake again.

The crown is secured,
but the soul of England groans.

Their disappearance is whispered in alleys and taverns. The people are not fooled. Mothers weep. Nobles shift uneasily in their chairs. Even your allies avoid your gaze.

Clarence vanishes from court.

Henry Tudor, once a distant threat in exile, now rides the storm of public outrage. Nobles flock to his banner. France sends gold. The wind has shifted.

⚔️ THE FINAL OUTCOME: "The Bloody Crown"
You are King. No heir of York challenges you now. But your throne is built on betrayal, falsehood, and child-murder.

The crown rests heavy.

Soon, at Bosworth Field, you will face Henry Tudor in battle. Your army will outnumber his. You will fight like a demon. You will kill many.

But fate is a silent dagger.

"A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!"

You die surrounded, abandoned by your own allies.

And so ends your reign: brilliant, ruthless, and doomed.

You played Richard as a serpent cloaked in brotherhood, a patient spider who struck when power was within reach.

But your greatest crime sealed your doom.

        The END
