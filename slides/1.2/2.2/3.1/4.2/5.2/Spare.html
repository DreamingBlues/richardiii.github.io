        You stay your blade.

Clarence lives. You call him before Parliament, flatter him, and grant him landsâ€”not out of affection, but to keep him within reach.

The princes remain in the Tower. You visit them. Smile. Speak kindly. You ensure their guards are your men. They are symbols nowâ€”untouched, yet powerless.

Instead of blood, you wield symbolism and legitimacy:

You marry Lady Anne Neville, linking yourself to royal Lancastrian blood and calming old foes.

You launch a public campaign, spreading rumors that you saved the realm from Queen Elizabethâ€™s scheming kin.

You reward loyal nobles. Punish dissent quietly. Let fear grow like ivy over stone.

In time, Edward V withers in obscurity, his name fading. Clarence, muzzled by wealth and veiled threats, learns to keep still. You rule without coronation, your power veiled in duty, your ambition cloaked in law.

ðŸŽ¬ FINAL OUTCOME: The Shadow King
You are never crowned, but you are never challenged. England calls you Protector, but all know who truly reigns.

The crown rests on a boyâ€™s head in a tower, but it is your will that bends the realm.

Your hands remain cleanâ€”your soul, perhaps less so.

        </br></br>
        THE END
