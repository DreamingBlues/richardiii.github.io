        The velvet mask falls. The dagger gleams.

You move swiftly. Clarence, once your ally, is found drowned in a cask of wine—"suicide," they say. Few believe it, but none challenge you. His death echoes through the court like a warning bell.

The young princes? Their laughter fades within the stone walls of the Tower. One night, their guards are dismissed. The next morning, their chamber is empty. London holds its breath. No bodies, no witnesses—only silence. And fear.

Your allies press you: the kingdom cannot be ruled by whispers and shadows forever. The path is clear now.

You step into Westminster Abbey and place the crown upon your own head.
"Long live King Richard III."

⚔️ THE ENDING: "The Iron Thorn"
You are king.

But it is a kingdom steeped in blood, suspicion, and ghosts.

The nobles obey, but their eyes watch your back.

The people murmur about murdered princes.

Queen Elizabeth mourns, but waits.

And in the distance, Henry Tudor, exiled in Brittany, gathers support.

Your throne is yours—for now.

        THE END
