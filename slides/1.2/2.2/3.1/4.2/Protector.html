        You present yourself before Parliament not as a usurper, but as a loyal uncle. The boy king is young, the times unstable, and someone must guide the realm.

"In the spirit of my late brother," you say, "I take no crownâ€”only the burden of guardianship. Let me be named Lord Protector, until the Prince is ready to reign."

The lords agree. Your restraint earns you respect, even from former enemies. Publicly, the court breathes easier.

Privately, however, you tighten your grip:

Clarence is increasingly suspicious, sensing your true ambition.

Supporters of the Queen realize too lateâ€”theyâ€™ve traded a coronation for a cage.

The Tower becomes a prison not just for Edward V, but for the fate of the Plantagenets.

You now rule without the crown, yet wield its power. Your enemies are quietâ€”but not blind.

ðŸ”€ Consequences:
You are officially Lord Protector of England.

Edward V is sidelined but still aliveâ€¦ for now.

The court believes you are loyal, buying you more time.

Clarence may soon become a liability.

        </br></br>
        Tension brews. Clarence begins speaking out in court, questioning your power. Queen Elizabeth plots from sanctuary. Even the common folk begin to whisper: Why has the boy not been crowned?

You know it cannot last. Either you act now to end all opposition, or you risk losing everything.

      1. Eliminate Clarence and the Princes
      <span class="details">
        Silence Clarenceâ€”accuse him of treason or have him quietly killed. Then ensure the princes in the Tower "disappear." With all rivals gone, you can be crowned king.

      2. Spare Them, But Cement Control
      <span class="details">
        Keep Clarence close, and keep the princes aliveâ€”but weaken their power. Marry Lady Anne for legitimacy. Consolidate your hold through alliances, propaganda, and fear. Rule from the shadows permanently.
