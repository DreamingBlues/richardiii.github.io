    <h1>
        You allow the boy king, Edward V, to be crowned.

The city bells ring, and the people cheer as the young monarch is paraded through the streets, flanked by Rivers, Dorset, and the Queen herself. You bow deeply before the throne and offer counsel, swearing loyalty.

Behind your smile, your mind sharpens.

With Clarence still by your side and the Queenâ€™s family distrusted thanks to your earlier whispers, you begin gathering influence quietlyâ€”inviting nobles, shaping opinions, playing both sides.

Young Edward looks to you with trust. You offer him chess lessons, sermons on kingship, tales of valor. In truth, you are indoctrinating him.

But the Queen grows suspicious.

"My son," she says to the boy, "beware the snake that speaks sweet truths."

Your time is limited.

ðŸ”€ Consequences:
Edward V is king, but malleable.

You gain subtle influence over the boyâ€”but not full control.

The Queen watches you closely now.

Clarence grows uneasy. He senses a deeper gameâ€¦ and may ask the wrong questions.
        </br></br>
        Clarence comes to you late at night, eyes filled with doubt.

"You said weâ€™d rule together, Richard. But I see you meeting with nobles. I hear whispers that Edward may be movedâ€¦ that his protectors may fall."

Heâ€™s loyalâ€”but only until he isnâ€™t. If he speaks out, your delicate balance will collapse. If you act too early, you risk turning the kingdom against you.

      1. Eliminate Clarence Quietly
      <span class="details">
        Poison his wine. Frame it on Queen Elizabethâ€™s allies. Mourn loudly. With him gone, your influence over the king deepensâ€”and the Queenâ€™s circle is blamed.

    <a href="4.2/Swear.html" class="choice">
      2. Swear Him to Your Cause
      <span class="details">
        Lay your plans bare. Reveal your vision: a unified kingdom under your command. Promise Clarence a co-regencyâ€”or even a future crown. Bring him deeper into your confidence.
