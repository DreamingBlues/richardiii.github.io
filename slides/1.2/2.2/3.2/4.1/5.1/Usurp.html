        You summon Parliament and present your case:

"Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth was invalid. His sons are illegitimate. The realm cannot be left to bastards."

Through forged documents, coerced priests, and terrified nobles, your claim is made law. The young Edward V and his brother are moved quietly into the Towerâ€”"for their safety."

They are never seen again.

On a storm-wracked July day, you are crowned Richard III, King of England.

The court applauds with cold hands. The people watch with wary eyes. But none dare challenge youâ€”yet.

ðŸŽ¬ Ending: "The Usurper's Crown"
You have taken it all:

Clarence: Dead by your hand.

The Queenâ€™s family: Destroyed.

The princes: Vanished.

The throne: Yours.

But beneath the crown lies a rot. Whispers grow. In the west, Henry Tudor rallies an army. In your sleep, you see the faces of the dead.

You are kingâ€”but for how long?
