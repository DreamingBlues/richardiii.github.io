        The next evening, Clarence dines with you in private chambers. The fire crackles. A silver cup is poured.

“To brothers,” you say, lifting the glass.

“To truth,” Clarence replies. He drinks.

Minutes later, he gasps. His cup falls. You leap up, shouting for guards—accusing Rivers’ steward, who delivered the wine. You weep at Clarence’s death in full view of the court. Your grief is a mask worn well.

Rivers and Dorset are immediately arrested. The Queen collapses with grief and fear. Her influence crumbles.

Young Edward, confused and frightened, turns fully to you.

“Uncle Gloucester,” he says, “who can I trust now?”

You kneel beside the boy.

“Only me, my king.”

🔀 Consequences:
Clarence is dead—murdered in secret and blamed on the Queen’s allies.

Rivers and Dorset are imprisoned; the Queen is powerless.

Edward V clings to you as his last protector.

You now control both throne and perception
        </br></br>
        You stand on the edge of power.

The boy king, Edward V, rules in name—but he is still a child. The nobles murmur: Why not make Gloucester Protector? Some even whisper: Why not king?

But young Edward still lives, and so does his younger brother Richard, Duke of York. Two boys stand in your way.

You must decide your final move.

      1. Usurp the Throne
      <span class="details">
        Have the princes declared illegitimate. Confine them to the Tower. Take the crown. You will be king—but the people's trust will hang by a thread. The shadows remember.

    <a href="5.2/Rule.html" class="choice">
      2. Rule from Behind the Throne
      <span class="details">
        Let the boys remain king and prince. Guide them as Protector. Stay the power behind the throne. Safer, quieter—more stable. But the crown will never be yours outright.
