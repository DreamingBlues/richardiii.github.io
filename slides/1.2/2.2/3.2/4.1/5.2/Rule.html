        You decline the crown.

With the Queen’s family broken and Clarence gone, the court nearly begs you to take power. But you speak humbly.

"I seek no crown, only the peace of this realm and the safety of my brother’s sons."

You are named Lord Protector of the Realm.

The young King Edward V sits on the throne, his brother beside him. They look to you in all things—uncle, mentor, shadow king. You reform the council. You exile dissenters. You "retire" old enemies. Each move strengthens your hold, yet you wear no crown.

Your reign is quiet, effective... and utterly controlled.

The people love their young king. The court fears you.
And England, for a time, knows peace—under your unseen hand.

🔚 ENDING UNLOCKED: “The King Without a Crown”
Richard remains uncrowned, but rules in all but name.
His enemies are buried, his allies unaware they’re being used.
History will not call him a usurper… but neither will it call him innocent.

    </br></br>
    THE END!
