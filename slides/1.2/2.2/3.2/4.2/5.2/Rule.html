        You gather your forces and strike swiftly—but not at the boy on the throne.

Instead, your men arrest Buckingham, seize Dorset, and scatter the last of the Queen’s supporters. Their lands are claimed. Their titles revoked. The Queen herself is placed under guard—honored, but powerless.

Clarence rides at your side, the “noble protector of the crown.” Together, you address Parliament not with ambition, but with reassurance.

“Young Edward shall reign,” you declare, “but he shall not be alone. The wisdom of his uncles shall shield him, guide him, prepare him to rule.”

You orchestrate the kingdom like a symphony:

Edward V remains a figurehead—bright-eyed and trusting.

You and Clarence become the power behind the throne.

Nobles are placated. The commoners are calmed.

And the dynasty appears stable—thanks to your shadow rule.

Years pass. Edward grows, but always under your influence. Clarence ages into a statesman. The wars are over. You hold no crown…

…but all the power of one.

🏰 Ending Unlocked: “The Spider Regent”
You never wore the crown. But you ruled as surely as any king.
A master of influence. A shadow behind the sunlight.
History will wonder: was Richard a villain… or the guardian the realm needed?

        THE END
