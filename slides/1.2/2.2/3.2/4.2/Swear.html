        You close the door, pour two cups of wine, and face Clarence as brothers—not pawns.

“George, I will not lie. Yes, I move pieces. Yes, I test loyalties. But not for ambition alone—for stability. Our house teeters. The boy is a child, the Queen's family vultures. We must act, not just rule.”

Clarence studies you. You speak of joint power—of a co-regency, of shared dominion while Edward V is young. He sees your passion… and perhaps believes it is genuine.

At last, he nods.

“If you betray me, brother… it will be the last face you ever see.”

“And if I don’t,” you reply, “then we wear crowns together.”

🔀 Consequences:
Clarence becomes your true ally.

Together, you begin steering young Edward V—through gentle nudges and carefully staged "choices."

The Queen’s family is isolated. Nobles begin backing your vision of unity and strength.

The realm watches—some with hope, others with fear.
        </br></br>
        A plot is uncovered. Buckingham—a powerful noble—has conspired with Queen Elizabeth and her exiled allies to remove you and Clarence from power.

You’ve come too far. You now stand at the edge of two destinies:

One where you rule behind the throne with Clarence.

One where you seize the crown itself and become king.

Clarence says, "We can still protect the boy. Rule in his name. There’s no need for blood."

But the nobles are restless. They fear instability. Many would follow a strong king... not a child guided by two shadows.

      1. Crown Yourself King
      <span class="details">
        Have Parliament declare the princes illegitimate. Take the throne. Clarence may resist—but you will be king in fact, not just in influence.

      2. Rule Behind the Throne
      <span class="details">
        Crush the Queen’s plot, exile her allies, and rule through Edward V. Keep Clarence close. Maintain your power through manipulation—not a crown.
