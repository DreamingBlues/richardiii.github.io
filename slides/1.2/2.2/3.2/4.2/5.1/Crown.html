    <h1>
        You speak to Parliament. You summon bishops, nobles, and scholars. You unveil an "ancient truth"—that King Edward IV’s marriage to Elizabeth was invalid, tainted by a prior betrothal. Therefore, young Edward V is a bastard, unfit to rule.

At first, the lords murmur. Then, one by one, they nod. What they fear more than tyranny is chaos. And you offer order.

“I take the crown not for ambition,” you declare, “but for England’s soul.”

The coronation bells ring once more—but this time for King Richard III.

Clarence confronts you in private.

“You swore we would rule together.”

“And we will,” you say. “But a crown cannot have two heads.”

He says nothing—but his eyes have changed.

🔀 Final Outcome:
You are crowned King Richard III.

Edward V and his brother vanish into the Tower. Their fate is sealed in shadow.

Queen Elizabeth flees to sanctuary; Buckingham rebels but is crushed.

Clarence begins to withdraw. He may yet betray you—or die regretting his loyalty.

You have power. But it is a lonely crown, built on deception, fratricide delayed, and a future uncertain.

🏰 Your Ending: “The Crown of Thorns”
You have seized the throne and outmaneuvered every rival.
But the cost is trust, peace, and family.
The people murmur. A new threat gathers across the sea: Henry Tudor.

Your reign has begun.
But your war is not over.
        </br></br>
        THE END
