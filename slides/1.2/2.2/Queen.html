    <h1>
        You attend the Kingâ€™s reconciliation banquet, smiling beside Clarence and bowing to Queen Elizabeth. Your face is all courtesy; your heart, all dagger.

Behind the scenes, your agents begin whispering.

"Rivers lines his coffers with French gold."
"Dorset is courting favor in the shadowsâ€”perhaps even eyeing the regency."

The court becomes uneasy. Queen Elizabethâ€™s family starts to look like power-hungry vipers to many nobles. Clarence, still trusting you, echoes your rumors without realizing their source.

As King Edward lies dying, his court begins to splitâ€”not between York and Lancaster, but between Queenâ€™s blood and Kingâ€™s brothers.

You remain innocent in the eyes of all.

ðŸ”€ Consequences:
Rivers and Dorset are now widely distrusted.

Clarence remains loyal and unaware.

The King, sensing instability, grows sicker with worry.

Upon his death, the kingdom will fractureâ€¦ just as you planned.
        </br></br>
        Edward IV is dead. The young heir, Edward V, is but a boy. By law, he should be crowned at once.

But the Queenâ€™s relatives, especially Rivers, seek to control him through a hasty coronation and a strong regency council.

You, as the late kingâ€™s brother, can challenge thisâ€”but openly doing so could spark civil war.

      1. Intercept the Prince
      <span class="details">
        Send armed men to intercept young Edward V on his journey to London. Escort him "safely" to the Towerâ€”under your protection. Say itâ€™s for his own good. This move seizes control without spilling bloodâ€”yet.

      2. Let the Queen Crown Him Quickly
      <span class="details">
        Play the patient counselor. Let them crown Edward Vâ€¦ but stay close. Use your influence over Clarence and others to steer the boy king behind the scenes. Trust in subtlety over force.
