        With cold calculation, you ride out to meet the Queen’s escort near Stony Stratford.

You arrive with a smile, cloaked in noble intentions.

“My dear Lords Rivers and Grey,” you say, bowing low before the young prince. “Surely, for the safety of His Majesty, it is best that I—his uncle and Protector—escort him to London.”

Rivers hesitates, but the guards are already surrounding them. With a flick of your hand, he is arrested for treason, accused of plotting to seize the Regency for the Queen.

The boy-king, Prince Edward, is bewildered—trusting, young, easy to sway.

“Fear not,” you say to him, gently placing a hand on his shoulder. “Your uncle will care for you. I have only your best interests at heart.”

🔀 Consequences:
Rivers and Grey are imprisoned. The Queen flees into sanctuary.

You escort the Prince to London and place him in the Tower, under the guise of security.

You now hold the future king in your grasp.

The Queen’s allies are in disarray—but suspicion grows.
        </br></br>
        You rule from behind a boy’s face. But not for long.

Your next move is to decide what to do with the two young princes—Prince Edward and his brother Richard of York, now both in the Tower.

You have planted rumors that the boys are illegitimate, born of an unlawful marriage. The people are murmuring. The nobles hesitate.

Now comes the fateful step.

        1. Declare the Princes Bastards and Take the Crown
        <span class="details">
            Have a bishop declare Edward’s marriage invalid. Claim the princes have no right to rule. Let the people beg you to take the crown “for the good of England.” It will still require violence... but cloaked in legality.        </span>

    <a href="4.2/Control.html" class="choice">
        2. Keep the Princes Alive but Under Control
        <span class="details">
            Rule as Lord Protector indefinitely. Groom the older prince to trust you completely. Let the people believe you're loyal—while subtly turning the child into a puppet. Fewer bodies, more whispers.
