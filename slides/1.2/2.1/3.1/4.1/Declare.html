        You summon Parliament.

A bishop‚Äîpliant and paid‚Äîdeclares King Edward‚Äôs marriage to Elizabeth Woodville invalid. Their sons, the princes, are thus declared bastards, unfit for the throne.

The nobles hesitate, but your voice is strong, your grip on the Tower firm, and your soldiers many.

Cries of ‚ÄúLong live King Richard III!‚Äù echo through the hall.

You ascend the throne.

The people are uneasy, but obedient. You are now King of England.

And the princes? Still locked in the Tower.
Still alive. For now.

But too many ask questions.

One night, under cover of darkness, two men enter the Tower with orders known only to you.

They do not come back out.

The stones of the White Tower are silent. The birds avoid its walls.
üîÄ Consequences:
You are now King Richard III.

The princes are gone. Many suspect you.

The Queen is in mourning, and her allies seethe.

The realm is yours... but unrest grows like fire under ice.

    </br></br>
    You have the crown, the court, and the cold.

    But word rises from across the sea: Henry Tudor, exiled in France, raises an army. He claims to unite the Lancastrians and disaffected Yorkists against your ‚Äúusurpation.‚Äù
    
    Your spies whisper: Buckingham, once your ally, may defect. Nobles sit on the fence, watching for which side will win.
    
    Your throne trembles.

            Execute Buckingham and anyone suspected of wavering. Rule by fear. Show the realm that treason brings death. It may secure your crown‚Äîor ignite the war sooner.

        2. Offer Amnesty and Rebuild Trust
        <span class="details">
            Send messages of peace. Try to pull wavering nobles back to your side. Promise land, favor, mercy. Delay battle, buy time, and try to divide Tudor‚Äôs support.
