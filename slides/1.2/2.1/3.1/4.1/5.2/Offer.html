        You stay your hand.

Rather than strike down Buckingham immediately, you send envoys‚Äîletters sealed with royal wax, filled with promises of forgiveness, titles, and land. You remind the nobles of your strength, but offer them a place in your reign.

Some are persuaded.

The Earl of Northumberland returns to your side.

Lord Stanley sends guarded messages of loyalty‚Äîbut keeps his full forces apart.

Even Buckingham wavers, caught between fear of your wrath and doubts about your sincerity.

But mercy delays, not denies.

Henry Tudor lands in Wales with an army of foreign mercenaries and disinherited Englishmen. Your own forces gather near Bosworth Field.

The final battle comes.

‚öîÔ∏è The Battle of Bosworth
Your troops outnumber Henry‚Äôs.

But Lord Stanley, whom you spared, does not charge when you call.

Buckingham never arrives.

The tide turns.

You, King Richard III, charge into the fray yourself, crying:

‚ÄúA horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!‚Äù

You fall. Sword in hand. Crown dented. Betrayed by the mercy you once withheld, then too late extended.

ü©∏ Your Ending:
Ending #6 of 32 ‚Äî "The Merciful Usurper"

You achieved the crown through cunning and blood‚Äîbut in the end, you chose diplomacy over destruction.
Your attempt to heal the wounds of your reign came too late to save your throne‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶but not too late to haunt your legacy with the question:

What if Richard had been more than a villain?

    THE END!
