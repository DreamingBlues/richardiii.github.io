        You summon Buckingham to court.

        “My king,” he begins, but you cut him off with a glare colder than steel.
        
        “You hesitated,” you growl. “At my coronation. At the Tower. You faltered in loyalty, and now you must fall.”
        
        Without trial, without mercy, Buckingham is executed.
        
        Across the realm, others follow—lords, knights, whispers of disloyalty met with iron and fire. The nobility trembles. The people grow quiet.
        
        You ride out to meet Henry Tudor’s army, now emboldened by your tyranny. Many nobles—who might have stayed neutral—flock to his banner, unwilling to serve under a butcher-king.
        
        On the fields of Bosworth, your army is outnumbered, your allies unreliable. Lord Stanley, whose son you hold hostage, refuses to commit his troops to your cause.
        
        In the chaos of battle, you charge for Henry himself, roaring:
        
        “A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”
        
        But no steed comes.
        
        You are surrounded. Beaten. Killed.
        🔚 Ending Reached: “The Tyrant’s Fall”
You rose through blood and treachery.

You seized the crown.

You ruled with fear.

But in the end, your tyranny united your enemies—and England cast you down.


    </br></br>
    THE END!
