        You decide not to spill royal blood.

Instead, you tighten your grip on the Tower and the princes within it. You charm young Edward V with stories of valor, kingship, and destiny—while feeding him a carefully edited view of the court. He trusts you, calls you “uncle,” smiles when you enter the room.

But the realm grows uneasy. Rumors swirl like London fog. Some whisper the princes are prisoners. Others say you cast spells in the Tower at night.

Then, one night, as you walk the ramparts alone, a cold wind rises—unnatural. A figure cloaked in smoke and cinders appears before you, half-man, half-specter.

"Three you have betrayed, Gloucester," it whispers. "One blood, one trust, one crown. The reckoning begins."

You reach for your sword—but it passes through the shade.

The next morning, young Edward speaks strange words at breakfast.

“I dreamed the Tower burned,” he says. “And you wore a crown of thorns, uncle.”

You smile... but your hands tremble.

🔀 Consequences:
You maintain power without openly seizing the throne.

The people grow fearful—supernatural omens spread.

The boys remain alive, but something unnatural stirs in the Tower.

Some say God's judgment is near.

        </br></br>
        Your power is great—but fragile.

Across the sea, Henry Tudor gathers forces. Nobles who once supported you now drift toward rebellion. The people whisper of omens and ghostly warnings. The Tower grows colder by the day.

You stand at the brink. One path leads to open tyranny, the other to a desperate grasp for redemption or rebirth.

        1. Seize the Throne and Prepare for War
        <span class="details">
            Crown yourself Richard III. Silence your enemies, purge the court. Let the princes vanish—forever. Armies will rise against you, but you will meet them on the battlefield, as king.

        2. Embrace the Supernatural Prophecy
        <span class="details">
            Seek the meaning of the specter’s warning. Consult the monks, the stars, the old magics. If destiny curses you, perhaps it can be undone. Perhaps… you can reshape your fate.
