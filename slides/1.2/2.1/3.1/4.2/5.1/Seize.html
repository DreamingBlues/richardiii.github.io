        You silence the Tower.

The princes vanish. No bodies, no cries—just an empty silence that echoes through history. The people fear you. The nobles despise you. But the crown fits.

You are crowned Richard III, King of England.

You crush dissent with ruthless efficiency. Hastings—dead. Dorset—hunted. The Queen, broken and hiding. The court bends the knee, trembling beneath your iron gaze.

But across the Channel, Henry Tudor sails with French gold and English exiles. They speak your name with hatred and prophecy. They say the rightful king is coming. That ghosts walk beside him.

You raise your armies. At Bosworth Field, steel meets prophecy.

The night before battle, the Tower’s ghost returns—joined by others:

Clarence, your brother, pale and gasping.

Prince Edward, silent and bleeding.

Even yourself, from another path.

“Despair and die,” they whisper in unison.

You wake, shaking. But you go to war.

The next day, your sword is mighty—but your allies falter. Stanley turns against you. Your horse is slain. You scream across the battlefield:

“A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”

But none come.

🩸 Ending: The King in the Dirt
You die sword in hand, crowned and alone.

The crown rolls from your head into the mud.
Tudor picks it up.

The Plantagenet line ends, and the Tudor dynasty begins. Your name becomes legend—villain, tyrant, ghost.

But somewhere… in another version of the story… a different Richard waits, watching.
    </br></br>
    THE END!
