    <h1>
        Haunted by the specter’s words, you withdraw from court and power. You leave the Tower one misted morning, veiled and unescorted, and ride north—alone.

You visit ancient abbeys, ruined Roman temples, and whispering forests. You seek the old monks of Lindisfarne, the stone circles of Cumbria, and the hermits who speak to stars. You sacrifice sleep for prophecy, blood for knowledge.

One night, beneath a lunar eclipse, you stand before a crumbling altar, carved with forgotten runes. There, the specter returns.

"You seek to undo what you have done," it hisses. "But to shift destiny, you must pay its price."

You kneel. “Then I offer myself.”

The air splits. A wind howls through the stone.

🔮 The Aftermath:
In London, the princes awaken one morning to find the Tower’s gates wide open. Their uncle is gone. No crown. No blood. No war.

Henry Tudor lands in England—but finds no Richard to fight.

Instead, he takes the throne almost peacefully, declaring himself king by marriage and divine favor.

Years later, rumors persist of a cloaked monk who wanders the north, healing the sick and carving cryptic prophecies into the stone.

Some say he is mad. Others say he once wore a crown he could never hold.

In time, bards sing of Richard the Broken, the Seeker King, and the Shadow Unmade.

🌑 Your Ending: The Penitent Pilgrim
You forsook the throne to confront a higher destiny.
You became a myth.
Not a king of England, but a whispered legend.
    </br></br>
    THE END!
