        Rather than strike openly, you choose subtlety.

You allow Rivers, Dorset, and Grey to escort young Prince Edward to London. You make no move against them, appearing as a loyal uncle. The court breathes easier. Queen Elizabeth dares to hope that peace might reign.

Behind the scenes, however, you whisper to Lord Hastings, playing on his pride:

"Rivers grows bold, cousin. Will he command the council next? Or will we remember our rightful place?"

Hastings listens. But so do others.

ðŸŒ€ The Unexpected Twist:
The Prince himself begins to question you.

Prince Edward, young but sharp, is suspicious.

"Why did Uncle Clarence vanish from court so suddenly? Why was he never brought back?"

Word of Clarence's fateâ€”his secret imprisonmentâ€”has reached the boy through servantsâ€™ gossip.

You realize too late: letting Rivers live gave the Queenâ€™s allies time to plant seeds of doubt in the boy's mind.

ðŸ”€ Consequences:
You retain your position as Lord Protector, for now.

Rivers and Grey live, and their influence grows within the court.

Prince Edward grows wary of youâ€”a dangerous thing in a future king.

But Lord Hastings and a few nobles remain quietly loyal.

The path ahead is darkerâ€”and more dangerous.

      </br></br>
      The coronation approaches. If Prince Edward is crowned, you are finished. You must either act now to seize powerâ€¦ or accept a future under his suspicious eye.

Youâ€™ve uncovered something new: Queen Elizabethâ€™s marriage to Edward IV may have been invalid, due to a prior betrothal. If proven, the prince would be illegitimate.

      1. Declare Edward's Children Bastards
      <span class="details">
        Use Dr. Shaa, a pliable preacher, to publicly declare the prince illegitimate. Bar the boy from the throne, and have yourself declared rightful heir by Parliament.

        Abandon pretense. March into Westminster with armed men, seize Prince Edward, and claim the throne by might. Eliminate Rivers, Grey, and possibly even Hastings, if they resist.
