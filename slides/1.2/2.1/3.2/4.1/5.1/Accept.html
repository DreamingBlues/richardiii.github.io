    <h1>
        You crown yourself King Richard III.

Despite the uncertainty, despite the vanished princes, despite the whispers—you claim the throne. You appear before Parliament in full regalia, flanked by Lord Catesby and a grim-faced Buckingham, who stands by you—but no longer with his old fire.

You deliver your speech:

“England bleeds from confusion. Her heirs, her law, her peace—all endangered. I take the crown not for ambition, but for order.”

Some cheer. Others murmur. But the crown is set upon your head.

🌀 The Final Twist:
The Queen has not remained idle.

Just days after your coronation, a message spreads through the countryside: Prince Edward lives, and has landed in Wales, under the protection of Henry Tudor’s supporters. It is not Henry who claims the throne—but Prince Edward himself, now raised up by loyalists as the rightful king in exile.

Even more astonishing—Buckingham defects. Furious at your broken promises and disgusted by your disregard for legitimacy, he joins the Queen’s cause and takes his army west.

🎭 FINAL CONSEQUENCES:
You are King, but your rule begins with rebellion.

The princes live. Their survival has made them symbols of resistance—and of your treachery.

Buckingham, once your key ally, now leads armies against you.

Queen Elizabeth becomes a shrewd political force, rallying former enemies under her banner.

The people are divided. Some fear you, others mock you. The nobles hedge their bets.

The war for England begins anew—and your reign hangs by a thread of steel.

👑 Your Ending: “The Crown of Ash”
You claimed the throne, but not the realm.
Your enemies live. Your crown is heavy. Your court is fractured.
The game continues—but now, you play against the tide of history itself.

    THE END!
