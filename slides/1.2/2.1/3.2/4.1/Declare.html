        You strike not with steel, but with scripture.

You summon Dr. Shaa, a preacher of weak morals but strong lungs. In a public sermon at St. Paul’s, he delivers your poisoned truth:

“Prince Edward is no true heir! The late king was betrothed to Lady Eleanor Butler before wedding Queen Elizabeth. His children are bastards!”

The crowd is stunned.

Lord Buckingham, your secret co-conspirator, spreads the message through the city. Nobles hesitate. Murmurs rise. Parliament begins to stir in your favor.

And then—something unexpected.

🌀 The Unexpected Twist:
Queen Elizabeth produces evidence:
A sealed letter from King Edward IV, signed and witnessed, denying the pre-contract with Lady Eleanor. A forged letter, perhaps—but convincing.

Lord Stanley—a cautious but powerful noble—declares the matter “uncertain.” Others echo him. Buckingham wavers, sensing a storm.

And worse—young Prince Edward disappears from sanctuary.

The Queen, fearing for her son’s life, flees London with him and his brother Richard, Duke of York, under disguise. They vanish into hiding, spirited away by loyal Yorkists.

You have no heir to unseat. No prince to hold. The throne dangles—untouched—but your claim is now weaker than ever.
🔀 Consequences:
The public declaration casts doubt on Edward’s heirs—but also casts doubt on you.

The princes have vanished, and cannot be "removed" as in history.

Queen Elizabeth becomes a symbol of resistance, a rallying figure.

Buckingham’s loyalty becomes uncertain.

Parliament hesitates to support your coronation.

The crown is closer than ever… yet somehow, further away.

      </br></br>
      London is tense. You reside in Baynard’s Castle, holding court. The throne is vacant. The princes are gone. Your enemies plot in shadow.

You receive two secret messages:

One from Buckingham, asking: “Will you strike, or will you fall?”

One from Queen Elizabeth, offering a negotiation: if you abandon your claim, she will support you as Protector of the Realm—regent to her sons, once they return.

      1. Accept the Crown Anyway
      <span class="details">
        Push forward. Have yourself crowned King Richard III, even with the princes missing. Proclaim yourself savior of England. Let doubt rot beneath your heels.

    <a href="5.2/Pretend.html" class="choice">
        Pretend to Yield, Then Strike in Secret
      <span class="details">
        Agree to Elizabeth’s offer. Publicly support the missing princes—then, in secret, send agents to find and eliminate them, one by one. No one will suspect you now.
