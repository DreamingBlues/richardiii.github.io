        You don the mask of peace.

With solemn words and a bowed head, you meet Queen Elizabeth at Westminster. The court breathes a sigh of relief.

"My lady sister," you say, voice calm as still water, "for England’s sake, I shall not wear the crown. Let me serve—as Protector to your sons—until they return."

She agrees.

You are hailed as a selfless uncle, the great reconciler. Bells ring. The people smile.

But behind the veil…
You send riders.

Gold exchanges hands in dark stables. Whispers move through the countryside: Find the boys. Ensure they never return. You entrust this mission not to nobles, but to foreign mercenaries, unknown in England. No one will trace their hands to yours.

Then, weeks later—your agents return. And they do not come alone.

🌀 The Final Twist:
They bring back only one boy.

The younger prince—Richard, Duke of York—has been found, captured, and… spared.

The elder—Prince Edward—escaped. Worse: he has joined forces with Henry Tudor, across the sea.

Your agent explains:

“The boy, sire… he spoke well. Promised titles. Lands. Even we were swayed. Some of us let him go.”

The remaining prince, Duke of York, is under your "protection." But his older brother, now allied with Tudor, is rallying a rebellion in France.

🎬 THE OUTCOME: "The Tyrant and the Boy King"
You rule as Lord Protector, with one prince in hand and one at war.

The people are split: some call you the savior of England; others whisper you are a shadow king.

The rebellion led by Prince Edward and Henry Tudor looms on the horizon.

Your grip on power is tight—but it is not absolute.

📜 Epilogue
You never wear the crown. But you wield its power.
You never sit on the throne. But you decide who lives and who dies.

The war is not over.

But for now… you have won.
