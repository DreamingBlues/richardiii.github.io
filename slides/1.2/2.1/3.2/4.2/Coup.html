        You storm Westminster.

With Sir Richard Ratcliffe at your side and a contingent of loyal guards, you seize Prince Edward from his chambers. Queen Elizabeth flees into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey, clutching her youngest son, Richard, Duke of York. The court explodes in panic.

Rivers, Grey, and Dorset rush to organize resistanceâ€”but you're faster. They are arrested. Lord Hastings, caught unprepared, protests your actions.

"This is no act of protectionâ€”this is tyranny!"

You accuse Hastings of conspiracy. On your word alone, he is executed within the hour.

The throne is within reach.

ðŸŒ€ The Supernatural Twist:
That night, as you sleep in the Tower, something unnatural stirs.

A phantom appearsâ€”Clarence, pale and waterlogged, eyes hollow from his secret drowning.

"Brother... brother... The blood is not yet dry..."

He speaks no more, but leaves your chamber icy cold.

When you wake, your left hand is dark with bruising, though no blow touched it. You hide it under a glove.

Your men whisper that the Tower is cursed.

ðŸ”€ Consequences:
Prince Edward is in your custody, a prisoner in all but name.

Rivers and Grey are executed; Dorset flees into exile.

Hastings is dead. Parliament is silent.

But your reputation has soured, and strange omens haunt your steps.

The boy king resists, refusing to speak to you.

The realm holds its breath.

      </br></br>
      The crown is yoursâ€”almost. All that remains is legitimacy. The public is uneasy. Ghost stories spread. The nobles fear your wrath.

But a new threat rises: Henry Tudor, from across the sea, rallies support. His claim is weakâ€”but growing. Your throne is not yet secure.

      1. Marry Elizabeth of York
      <span class="details">
        Unite the York and Lancaster lines. Marry the daughter of Elizabeth Woodville, the Queen, and sister of the two princes. This could heal the nationâ€”and silence rebellion.

        Execute Prince Edward and His Brother
        
    <span class="details">
        No witnesses. No rivals. End the boy king and his younger brother, Prince Richard. Bury the past. The people may whisper, but no one will challenge a ghost.
