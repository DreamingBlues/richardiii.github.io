    <h1>
        You summon Queen Elizabeth, still in sanctuary, under flag of truce. She comes, pale and wary, believing you mean to kill her sons.

Instead, you propose something unthinkable.

"Let the past rot," you say. "Let Clarence sleep. Let your sons live. Give me your daughter, Elizabeth of York, and I shall give England peace."

The Queen, desperate for her children’s lives, agrees.

Your marriage to Elizabeth of York stuns the nation. It unites the feuding houses of York and Lancaster, cutting the legs from beneath Henry Tudor’s cause.

Even your most bitter enemies hesitate.

🔀 Final Consequences:
Prince Edward and Prince Richard live, hidden from court life but untouched.

The people grumble—but also hope. A peace born of blood and compromise.

Your crown is accepted, if not beloved.

Henry Tudor’s invasion falters, his support splintered by your unexpected alliance.

But the phantom of Clarence returns one final time—this time joined by Hastings, Rivers, and Grey. They stare silently at your marriage bed.

You rule.

But sleep eludes you.

🏰 ENDING UNLOCKED:
“The White Rose Pact”
Richard III survives. England is (briefly) at peace. The Princes live. But the ghosts never leave the Tower.
    </br></br>
    THE END!
