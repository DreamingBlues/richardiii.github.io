        One moonless night, you summon Sir James Tyrrell.

"There areâ€¦ two within the Tower," you murmur, voice cold as stone. "And their breath troubles my sleep."

Tyrrell bows. No questions asked.

That night, Prince Edward and Prince Richard are smothered in their sleep. Their tiny bodies vanish into the stoneâ€”buried in secret, beneath a stair. The deed is whispered through the court, never proven, but everyone knows.

Queen Elizabeth retreats into silent mourning. London shudders.

But your handâ€”the one marked by Clarenceâ€™s ghostâ€”blackens further. You feel it now: cold, always. It never heals.

ðŸŒ€ The Supernatural Repercussion:
The Tower groans with unnatural sounds.
Children claim to hear crying behind the walls.
The ravens never leave the battlements.
And youâ€¦ you begin to see them, in dreams:

Clarence, weeping blood.

Edward IV, coughing curses from his deathbed.

Hastings, jawless, screaming with no sound.

And nowâ€”two small shadows, standing at your bed each night, silent, staring.

ðŸ”š Ending Path â€” "The Withered Crown"
Your rise was absolute.

You are crowned King Richard III, unopposed. But the realm is sickened. Nobles whisper. The people fear youâ€”but they do not love you.

And across the sea, Henry Tudor lands in Wales, greeted by men who once wore your sigil.

The final battle looms.

You will ride to Bosworth, knowing that the ghosts of your making ride with you.

Whether you win or fallâ€”that is another game.

    THE END!
