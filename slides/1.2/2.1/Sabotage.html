        You betray Clarence.

        In secret, you whisper to Edwardâ€™s inner circle that Clarence has grown restless. You forge documents hinting at treasonâ€”old allegiances, half-truths, twisted meanings. You even leak false confessions from supposed spies claiming Clarence plots against the king.
        
        Edward, weakened and guilt-ridden, doesn't want to believe itâ€¦ but your evidence is damning. At the court gathering, the reconciliation falls apart.
        
        Clarence is arrested.
        
        "Brother!" he shouts as guards seize him. "You knew! You knew this would happen!"
        
        You look at him, eyes cold and unreadable.
        
        "I tried to warn you," you lie, soft as silk.
        
        ðŸ”€ Consequences:
        Clarence is imprisoned, but not yet executed.
        
        The Queenâ€™s family remains intactâ€”suspicious of you, but unaware of your role in Clarenceâ€™s downfall.
        
        King Edward grows sicker, plagued by guilt.
        
        You have now begun your dark ascentâ€”but youâ€™ve made enemies.

      King Edward IV is dead.

The throne passes to his young son, Prince Edward, barely a boy. As his uncle, you are named Lord Protectorâ€”a position of great power.

But the Queenâ€™s familyâ€”Rivers, Dorset, and her alliesâ€”plan to escort the prince to London and control the Regency. If they succeed, your time as Protector will be short.

      1. Intercept the Prince and Arrest Rivers
      <span class="details">
        Stage a noble intervention. Claim you're protecting the boy from manipulation. Arrest Rivers en route. Seize control of the Prince. From there, the Towerâ€”and powerâ€”is within reach.

    <a href="3.2/Continue.html" class="choice">
        Let the Process Continue Publicly
      <span class="details">
        Avoid confrontation. Let the Queen's party arrive in London, then work politically to sway the court. Influence nobles. Turn public opinion. It's slowerâ€”but less dangerous.
