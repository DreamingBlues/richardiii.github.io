        In secret, you whisper to Edward’s inner circle that Clarence has grown restless. 

        Edward, weakened and guilt-ridden, doesn't want to believe it, but your evidence is damning. 
        At the court gathering, the reconciliation falls apart.
        
        Clarence is arrested.

        
      </br></br>
      Plagued by guilt, King Edward's illness gets the better of him, only a week later is he declared dead.

        The Queen’s family remains intact—suspicious of you, but unaware of your role in Clarence’s downfall, as they arrive to London.


The throne passes to his young son, Prince Edward, barely a boy. As his uncle, you are named Lord Protector, a position of great power.
